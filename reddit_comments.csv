I’m not suicidal (anymore) I’ve realized that doesn’t work after trying for so many years and it killed a part of me I may never get back. That was my childhood from as young as I can remember till about 18. Repressed some stuff and was good for a couple years but it is all coming back. 

I never know how I will wake up the next day. Will I be trans? Will I be an angry person? Will I be super sexual or not sexual at all? Will I be contemplative? Will I be high energy or low energy? Will I be motivated or severely depressed? Will everything make sense or will it feel futile? Will the world feel simple or complicated? 

There is NO consistency in my life! NONE. And I am struggling so much. I moved out from my family home about 6 months ago and I still feel so off. Like I’m living only a quarter life. 

I go to work, go home, and I spend about an hour stuck in the car before I make it inside. Say hey to roommates I don’t like. And retreat to my room. Where I either scroll videos, or freak out existentially. 

I have a good job with a great company. I have a partner who I adore. She is still 2 hours away but it’s better than the 9.5 each way I used to have to drive. 

I’m moving into my own place next month and barely have enough saved for the security deposit and first months rent. And it’s only because I have about $2000 on my credit cards. (I could pay those off rn but then I wouldn’t have money for the deposit) 

I’m mentally in a crisis constantly going between periods of everything is perfect to the world is burning and I’m burning with it. 

I have an initial evaluation with a psychologist, but I worry I’m above his pay grade. And I need help now. Not in weeks. Now. Because I am in crisis. I wanted to go to a psych ward the other day but I know that would only make things worse. 

My parents denied me mental health care growing up and I was deeply suicidal and dissociated. Now I’m an adult and I’m trying to do it, but it’s all coming down on me. I don’t know how to cope. 

I’m sorry if this sounds whiny. I wish I was able to shove it all down again. But this all came out with the realization I’m trans. I am scared of losing everything I’ve worked so hard for. My partner, my work, my freedom. 

Please help. I don’t know where to begin because I am so far in the hole. I am so far I can’t even tell that I’m in a hole anymore.

He verbally abuses me constantly. If I cry, he laughs until I stop. He calls my pain “crocodile tears” and mocks me, like my emotions are some joke. And in the middle of all of this, he still expects to get what he wants—his needs always come first, no matter what I’m going through.

Whenever something bad happens in his life, I’m the first one he blames. He tells me I’ve changed him for the worse, that I’m not “feminine” or “soft-spoken” enough. But I feel like I’ve lost myself completely. I’ve started screaming back because I just can’t take the verbal attacks anymore, and then I hate myself for reacting that way.

I don’t have a big circle of friends. My life has revolved around this relationship for so long that I don’t even know what I’d do without it. But I feel so drained, so lost. Meanwhile, all our friends are moving forward—getting engaged, married, settling down—and I’m just stuck.

MentalHealthSupport,"I (20M) was born in a fairly well to do family to two loving parents. I had a fairly normal childhood. I was really good academically and I used to play a lot of sports. I used to get into trouble a lot in school for being a mischievous kid. I used to be a nice confident kid who was popular in school. I have an older brother who was just also academically gifted and he turned out to do wonderful things in  his life. I always fell short compared to him but my parents expected highly from both of us. It was always the case. If I got anything less than 95% my family would be disappointed in me. I didn't really receive much praise when I did anything great either. It wasn't like my parents didn't love me they did with all their heart but I always chased the standard they set for me and I wasn't able to reach it most of the time. I ended up spending so much time chasing their approval I forgot to live my childhood days and my early life flashed by. I saw others enjoying their life and being happy while I was chasing the approval and praise of my parents that I wasn't able to get. I saw my friends fall in love with each other and I felt like I was missing out on joy from my life. But I wasn't able to talk to women properly because I spent most of my life chasing excellence academically cause my family valued that. 
Everything changed in my life when I went to 11th grade. I wanted to pursue engineering like my brother. He got into IIT and my parents expected the same from me. I too went towards the same path thinking I would be able to achieve the same success. But getting into IIT was no easy task. I had spent a huge portion of my life convinced by my parents that if I work hard then I'll be happy later. I was told to work hard till 10th and then I can enjoy my life. I wasn't able to join the school football team due to my parents telling me to focus on academics. I did but in 11th grade my academics got a lot harder. At some point I started wondering what was the point of it all. I spent most of my life focusing on academics. Every year they told me to work hard and that I can enjoy later. My joy in life was postponed continuously and I stopped believing in it.  I was frustrated with the fact that I missed out on so much in my life. I never had a serious relationship with a girl or persue my passion for sports. My academics dropped due to my frustration and my parents started getting upset with my performance in academics but like my joy in life I also gave up on satisfying my parents. Every time I did well I got minimal praise and they told me they expected better. I soon started losing interest in everything. I gave up on my academics. I simply lost the will to work hard. My parents tried to motivate me again by telling me to just work hard for 2 more years and get into college but it was too late. I already lost hope in everything. How could I believe them when they said two more years when they have always told me to postpone my happiness. Could they guarantee my life would be great if I just worked hard for two years? Will my life become great magically after I join a good college? Will my hard work and sacrifice of Happiness be compensated? I couldn't get any answer to these questions and soon I lost the will to do anything. I soon lost the will to live and planned to end my life but when I thought about it I realised that my parents had invested everything in me. They spent so much of their time, energy and money on me that if I just ended myself then I would have been the worst investment ever. I thought I would will myself throughout my life at least until I could repay them financially so that I would be a disappointment but at least not a financial disappointment. I soon started hating my life. Every time I ate food I felt I was a worthless consumer of resources. I somehow finished my 12th grade but I obviously couldn't get into IIT as I was not in the right state of mind.    I joined a mediocre college whose fees was a lot more expensive than IIT. My parents told me it's alright and told me to atleast work hard in college. Now my brother is in IIT and I am stuck in a mediocre college. I can't help but think how much better of a financial investment my brother was compared to me. I don't blame my parents either. They had good intentions. They only wanted the best for me and my brother. They loved me unconditionally. They expected a lot from me but never failed to show me love. I hate myself for being a disappointment to them. They don't say anything to me but every second of my life it hits me that I'm nothing but a blob of flesh that consumes resources like a leach from my parents. All I wanted to enjoy my life. I really do love my parents and I want to give back for everything they have done for me but I simply do not have the mental strength to carry on. I don't think I will get the chance to pursue happiness in this lifetime but I don't want to be the cause of sadness for my parents who I love dearly.

I have been with my wife for 4 years. When we got together I found out she was addicted to Xanax, and I helped her quit. Unfortunately the withdrawals landed her on a 72 hour hold. I continued to help her and she has now been free of Xanax for 3.5 years. Our relationship has always been extremely loving, playful, and communicative. Well, the other morning we woke up, shared some genuine laughs, had breakfast, and I went to work. When I came home for lunch, she had a sad look on her face so I asked what was wrong. She plainly said, I hate my life, I want a divorce. I was speechless, I didn’t see it coming. I returned to work, and when I got home she was at work (she works evenings). I waited up for her to get home at her usual time around midnight. I asked her if we could talk, and she coldly said no, and immediately went to sleep on the couch, I was crushed, and went to bed.

The next morning when I woke up, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I pulled out my pistol, chambered a round, and put the gun to my head. I was thinking of the good times we had, and just couldn’t understand why this was happening to me. I began to sob uncontrollably, with tears and snot falling profusely. My wife walked in, and yelled at me to put the gun down, and ran to the other room. I sat there crying, and decided to put the gun down. I found my wife and asked her to drive me to the hospital so I could admit myself before I hurt myself. 

During my time in the psych ward, I would call my wife daily, and as we talked, things between us seemed to get better. She said she no longer wanted a divorce but wanted to get her own place and just separate for a little. I told her she could take all the time she needed. She told me it had nothing to with wanting to see anyone else, and that she had no interest with being with anyone right now. She just needed time to think.

On the 4th night of my stay, I called her and could her she was out at a bar. She told me she was, and that she had came there with two female coworkers and their husbands. I told her to have fun, and to be safe. She thanked me, told me she loved me, and said good night.

When I got out of the hospital after 6 days she picked me up, and we held each for two minutes tightly, sobbing in the lobby of the hospital. We told each other we loved each other, and the next few days seemed to be like our love was brand new, and stronger than ever. She was falling asleep in my arms, and waking me with little kisses. 

Then out of nowhere she said she no longer wanted to sleep in the same bed, and that she would be moving out in less than 30 days. It felt so strange, and heartbreaking. Now when you know your spouse, you know when something doesn’t feel right. That night, I did what many consider to be crossing a line, and went in her phone. The first message I see, is from the night I was in the hospital when she was at the bar, and is her telling a coworker that she lied to me about who she was out with and that she was staying at some guys house. 

I woke her up, and confronted her. She swore that nothing happened between them, and she felt guilty not telling me. However she was upset with me for going in her phone. In my defense, throughout our entire relationship, we have both said we could go in each others phone because we never had anything to hide. But now that there was something to hide, it’s like the rules changed. I’m incredibly depressed, and have no one to talk to.",Just served 6 days in a psych ward,1743831559.0,1jrwgln

MentalHealthSupport,"Ever since I was a child, I had fear of the opposite sex. I was educated in a Catholic school. Then somehow I got into a long relationship ever since high school and then caved myself in after the breakup hence had no avenue to explore dating. I remember, even in that first relationship when I was in a room with that girl, I hugged her for 2 seconds, and then said I'm feeling sleepy to hide my nervousness. I didn't touch her anything beside the hug. I took 1 full year to get to a kiss. In 4 years of relationship, never had sex. She used to tell me that she isn't ready and I was totally okay with waiting as I envisioned the future together. The two other relationships had been via tinder in the last year. I was somewhat orally sexually active (not penetrative sex) in the 2nd one, because she wouldn't have sex with me. I tried bringing it up many times in our short lived relationship but she wouldn't want to have sex with me. I was ready to wait for when she was ready. This relationship ended by her cheating on physically (having sex with another guy she met later in the office). So, yeah, we never had sex. This girl still dared to call me 2 times after this. Both times I told her there's no point as we can't have anything again.

And finally had sex the first time in my third relationship. However, this was on the 2nd date. This was a very short lived, casual relationship from both ends. But I'm elated that I atleast had sex, cos I had turned 29.

Apart from the serious relationship stuff, whenever I'm been single the last 1.5 years I've tried going out and dating (as they say). It's been very tough and very depressing. At the end of it, it fills me up with negative thoughts about myself, breaking my confidence and making me lose my will to even live sometimes.

Whenever I go out, I encounter this extreme phobia of rejection at moments which makes me:

1. Shy away/decide I'm there for other stuff and focus on that and that itself so that I don't have to feel conflicted internally
2. Decide by myself that the answer's going to be no. I do ask, but not with intention.
3. Have crippling anxiety as soon as I see a situation developing
4. I start blanking out when talking to the other sex
5. Overcompensate my shortcomings via various displays of overly extroverted behaviour only to let down the persona by turning out to be massively shy
6. I attribute all this to bad judgement?

MentalHealthSupport,"You know.  
There hasn’t been a single day where I didn’t go to the search bar and type in your ID.  
Every single time, my heart racing.  
Worried maybe this time I’ll see nothing. That maybe you’ve finally blocked me. That maybe it’s over for real now.  
But I still check.  
Still hope.  
I loved [you.So](http://you.So) much.  
Even writing this, I can feel my eyes welling up. My chest gets heavy. My heart just… hurts. Shaking constantly.  
I loved you in a way I don’t think I’ll ever love anyone again.  
I used to post pictures on Facebook,adjusting the settings so only you could see them.  
Every story was for you.  
Just you.  
I don’t even know if you ever noticed.  
But I kept doing it anyway.  
Because somewhere deep down I thought, maybe you still cared enough to see me. Even from a distance.  
I used to think about vlogging just recording my life, the ordinary moments.  
Not for the world.  
Just so maybe you’d come across it and feel like you were still part of my life. Of all people, I'd want you to know, anything that were to happen.   
And now?  
You ignore me like I’m nothing.  
Like I never mattered.  
And on the rare days you chose to reply, it felt like you were punishing me. Making me feel small. Like I was [annoying.Like](http://annoying.Like) I was something you had to tolerate.  
And I sat with that.  
I swallowed it whole.  
I let myself believe maybe I deserved that kind of treatment.  
  
I’ve spent months, validating every wrong thing you’ve said to me.  
Every harsh word. When really, nobody deserves to be spoken to like that, to have to go through all that. You know what you did to me, what you made me go through. And it all still haunts me. But.  
I sat down with those words, with your actions, with everything you threw at me and turned them over in my head until they made some kind of sense.I forgave you.  
Not because you deserved it.  
But because I had to.  
Because if I didn’t, I would’ve lost myself completely. Something I'd never be able to express enough for anyone to understand.  
And even now, even after all this time…I still love you.  
I still want to make it work.  
I literally spent time trying to figure out your Tithi birthday. I think it’s April 11th, I’m still not even sure.  
But I set a reminder to wish you at midnight.  
Because I wanted you to feel special.  
Because that’s how much I loved you. At this point, i think for me it's more about making you realise how much i love you, rather than actually getting you back, i don't want it be that way, but it is what it is.  
Even Rohit,your best friend,the one you always say means so much to you,   forgot your birthday once.   
  
I wanted to wish you on April 11th. And the 15th too.  
At midnight here, and at midnight in the US, where you are now.  
But I can’t.  
You’ve blocked me.  
And now I sit here wondering if I should still send you an email.  
If it would even matter.  
If you’d even care.  
April 11th… that was supposed to be my last call.  
Maybe April 15th too.  
After that, I told myself I wouldn’t do this anymore.  
It’s just cost me too much.  
My mental health is wrecked. It's never been this bad.  
I’ve never felt so empty, so hollow.  
And I can’t keep doing this to myself. It's time i prioritize myself.   
I’ve given everything. Everything I had.For you. For us, if even a little of it is left.  
I loved you with all I had.  
And if it wasn’t real, if it wasn’t deep, then why am I still here?  
Still feeling all of this, still stuck in the same place, after two whole years?   
You blocked me.  
And I’m still sitting here trying to figure out what I did.  
Was it because I stood my ground?  
Was it because I didn’t let you break me?  
Because I refused to fall apart just to make you feel strong?  
Was I too fiery? Too put together this time?  
Was it too much for you that I didn’t beg? That I didn’t let you walk all over me?Is this really how it ends?  
Will you come back?  
Do I still try?  
Do I still care?  
Because I do.  
And that's the truth.   
And you know what I keep thinking about? My roman empire ho ki k ho vancha ni.  
That call on January 1st.  
You were so soft that day.  
You sounded like my \*\*\*\*\*\* again.  
The version of you I still love.  
The one I miss every single day.  
You told me to either marry early or wait.  
I told you my body isn’t in the best shape. That maybe no one would want to marry me.  
And you said, “I’m right here. I would.”  
You said we’re not supposed to hurt each [other.You](http://other.You) said maybe we’re meant to be that’s why we always end up back here.  
That’s why it kept cycling.  
Repeating.  
That call was the sweetest conversation we’ve ever had.  
And if I had to choose how to remember you, I’d remember that you.  
The soft one.  
The kind one.  
The mero \*\*\*\*\*\*.   
  
I love you, \*\*\*\*\*\*.  
Even now.  
Even after everything.  
Even when it hurts.  
Especially when it hurts.   
I truly do, and still want you just as much.   
Still down to go through it all, if it means for you and me to be happy with each other.

It’s recently been summer and we’re coming into autumn and most nights I become anxious and unsettled but tonight it was full on. My face was numb, my hands felt small? And tingly. I was nauseous and mildly irritable directed towards sensory things like too much moving, things touching my hands. My breath was shaky and my heart was fast. My vision becomes darker too, things aren’t as bright. This only lasted about half an hour to an hour, and I didn’t catch on straight away what was happening and I thought I was dying or going to die.

MentalHealthSupport,"I felt like there was no way out. Every day was like a looped movie: the same thoughts, the same heaviness, the same emptiness.

Everyone around me said: “Just stop thinking about bad things”, “Do something useful”, but it only made things worse. That's when I started looking for what really works, not just sounds pretty.

The first thing I did was to stop blaming myself for my condition. It's not weakness, it's not laziness, it's a real problem.

Second - I stopped looking for one magic pill and tried a combination: therapy, physical activity, support from loved ones.

Third, I forced myself to get out of isolation. Let it be for short meetings or even just online conversations, but it had an effect.

I can't say that everything magically went away, but once I realized - I feel the taste for life again.

Tw medication?

I started taking antidepressants since I was 16yo. Im now 22yo...
I took alot of pills daily to sleep & for anxiety & depression.

My doctor even gave me benzos (zolpidem + temesta). Now I'm a few months benzo free. I take effexor + trazedone +catapressan.....which im very proud of.
Now ive been struggling with my stomach. My gallbladder is full with stones & stuff. So next week I'm gonna get surgery. But my doctor still tells me that my stomach can still hurt after because of all the medication I took / still take.

I wanna be medication free one day. Im gonna try with my psychologist doctor to ask to stop everything slowly. Has some of you did this? How was it? Did u feel worse after stopping? Can you still sleep even without the meds? Do you feel okay ish without the medication?

MentalHealthSupport,"My brother talks to himself nonstop anymore, and he does so in public. It’s not really talking out loud, he does that at home when he’s alone. In public it’s like silent talking/rambling to himself, with hand gestures and everything. This has been an ongoing issue for several years now that has progressively gotten worse. He will also laugh, make random sounds like humming and other noises. He also fidgets A LOT, and will sometimes rub his hands together. He never acted this way when he was younger, I believe it started in his mid twenties and just slowly progressed.

Some backstory about him is he’s been addicted to meth before. Not sure how long he did it for but I’m wondering if that is what did significant damage to him mentally? Apart from that he is a major stoner and an avid drinker. I’m talking like he drinks and smokes weed daily.  He is also a very lonely person and doesn’t really have a whole lot of friends as far as I know. I don’t even think he’s ever even had a girlfriend. He’s 33 years old now. I don’t know if that is due to his behaviors or just him being somewhat socially awkward in general. He also can’t seem to hold a job for more than 6 months without getting fired. He has been living with my dad and is lucky that he is patient and willing to help him out when he loses his jobs, but I know the stress of dealing with my brother has to be taking a toll on my father whose almost 70 now.

Any ideas on what could be the issue? I want to have a sit down conversation with him about it and want him to try to seek some professional help and I think having some idea as to what might be the issue may help, but who knows.

He's told me that he has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and I believe he definitely has depression and maybe anxiety. Yesterday I hadn't heard from him all day which was odd, didn't think much of it until I really thought about his last text to me. ""I love you. Sorry for everything."" I assumed that was directed to me being sick but then realized what that also could have meant. So I called him a few times and nothing.

I talked him down into staying here but idk what to do now. I want to bring up therapy and tell him that it might be best to seek some help but I don't want him to take offense and end up doing something rash, and if I'm honest, I don't have the energy to handle this.

Recently, I got a job and moved to a different city. I came back home on leave for a few days and bought my brother an expensive shirt as a gift. But he didn’t like it because he thought it was too expensive. We argued about it since I wanted him to accept it, and I got a bit too rude. Suddenly, my dad got angry at me for arguing with my older brother.

I felt bad and left the conversation. After that, I started ignoring both my dad and my brother for 3–4 days. On my last day at home, I felt guilty and decided to talk to my dad. I sat near him for a few seconds and told him it was my last day at home. There was an awkward silence—until I suddenly heard him weeping. In that moment, I hugged him, and he broke down crying.

Seeing my dad cry shattered my heart, and I started crying too, hugging him tightly. My dad never cries, and watching him like that hurt me so deeply that I can’t get it out of my mind.

I don’t know why I avoided talking to him for days. Am I really a bad son? I can’t express this feeling, and I don’t know how to cope with it.

I live in Australia and via reddit I met a person in the U.S. This person disclosed to me that they were feeling suicidal. For 3 years I've done my best to support and nurture this person to get them back on their feet however in the last month their mental health has taken a drastic turn and for the worst and they have transitioned from not wanting to live to actively wanting to die.

He is transgender and socially isolated 
He has autism
He has diagnosed PTSD depression and anxiety 
He has regular severe nightmares
He has visual and auditory hallucinations 
He was raped as a child twice
He is in constant chronic pain caused by his lupus and undiagnosed stomach issues. 
The pain causes him to wake up at 3am each day unable to go back to sleep. The pain is excruciating.
His parents refuse to take him to the hospital and refuse to give him any pain medication 
Jayden refuses to seek professional help (this includes calling or texting 988) as he has an enormous fear of being admitted to a mental hospital as the last time he was in a mental hospital he was abused by the staff.
He is self harming as a coping mechanism and smokes weed
Jayden refuses to go to the police to report the abuse he experiences at the hands of his parents as he fears that his older brother who is non verbally autistic will be placed in a foster care where he will be abused as this has happened in the past. 
There are no teachers that Jayden feels comfortable going to for assistance.

MentalHealthSupport,"i (f19) have been going through a mental health crisis since around november last year. 
after a lot of discussion my parents and i decided that spending some time in a mental health facility would be super beneficial to getting me back on track. i haven't worked since january, and i can barely leave the house. it's been really hard lol.
my therapist, family, boyfriend, and friends are all very supportive and think that this is a good idea. i agree with them.
but im starting to freak out a bit.
it was my idea, because i haven't been this bad in years, and i haven't been coping well with just therapy. we've signed up for private health and im going into a private hospital, so im not overly stressed about the place/experience specifically...
the hospital is about an hour away from where i live, and i've never lived away from home before. it's a 21 day program, where i am allowed to go out during the day etc. it's voluntary admission so there are some benefits to that. 
i guess im just psyching myself out about it... i've turned my whole family's life upside down and i feel so terrible even though i know it's not something i can control.
i'm scared to not be down the hall to my parents, not have my dog with me, and be far away from my friends and boyfriend and just everyone. i have friends living in the city the hospital is in, but it's not my best friend. i have barely been able to see anyone except my best friend and boyfriend because i have been so nonfunctional.
i'm just so scared and i don't know how to ease my anxiety. i know it will be okay, but i can't shake this fear. i'm so close with my parents, and i know they'll visit, but it's going to be hard on everyone, not just me... im so scared and i feel so so guilty. i don't know what to do

MentalHealthSupport,"I would sell my soul to play soccer again and experience the simple daily practices and weekly tournaments all over again. The rush of performing well during a scrimmage or game when you’re doing horribly in school and your life feels like it’s falling apart, that’s the part that I miss so much it stabilized me and made me feel worthy and confident and smart and proud. I miss being able to feel that way, it’s been a really long time, I wish I kept playing in high school 🥲 I connected emotionally with the sport and my brain was at complete ease while I was playing, it calmed my adhd and was just the perfect sport for me. When my parents couldn’t comfort me I always knew I had soccer, it was always guaranteed I would go to practice no matter what, whether I was fighting with my mom or dad, or my grades sucked, or I was sad and drained, or I had horrible anxiety, or I was depressed, or I made a big mistake, or I didn’t have my homework done, or I was hurt by friends, I always always always went to practice. It kept me alive, that’s something my dad always says and I understand it now that I’m 20. You can’t duplicate that feeling with anything, not even drugs.

MentalHealthSupport,"TRIGGER WARNING: Family problems, Bullied,  Physically Harassed, SA, Suicidal, Mental health problems, Financial problems, toxic environment, dreamless








Please take note this isn't just me giving up or quitting college just because I feel like it. I'm having a lots of problems and I've been suicidal since I was in 3rd grade/year 3rd. Bullying only stopped after COVID era, but it didn't with my family and relatives. I've been told a failure, useless, worthless and dumbass by my own family since I was a minor, I'm not an overachiever student anymore, I quitted playing chess after them being disappointed for me being only in second place and slowly, I'm detoriating along with my academic performance. I don't have much genuine friends in school, and most guys harassed me if I ever tried to make friends with them since that time I play video games too. 


All my life, I've been waiting for my fate to kill me either in accident, murder or me finally getting the courage to kill myself. I never expected to survive being a young adult, thrown with responsibilities I'm not prepared yet mentally and physically, I blame myself since I didn't kill myself and I was a huge coward for not doing it years ago. 


I don't have any ambitions or dreams, and I couldn't get my childhood dream back since it's been shattered when I was little, being told harsh realities about money and how useless it is. 


I do have severe family problems(physical and verbally harm) and as much as I want or needed a therapy or a psychiatrist for my diagnosis, I've been told by my family it's a waste of time and money and it won't really help me in the long run. 

I forced myself to study college since everyone is telling me that I need to do this so I could have a job that will qualify me more, and it needs to be within my interest(which is none). No matter what I pick, it just doesn't interest me at all, I'm not really mentally and physically ready for the stress with all activities, homeworks and projects they're throwing at me with lots of subjects to study. And without a college degree, no one will accept or hire me, even as simple as a janitor. 


Everything is stressing me out, since I don't even want to live, I'm only staying alive for my partner and trustworthy friends who's been there for me in ups and downs. My health is detoriating, I've been neglecting myself that I'm having cavities, anemia and cold every 2 weeks. I'm so stressed out that my head feels like exploding from pain, and now it's happening in my stomach too, it cramps a lot and I don't even release any shit. I don't have any healthy way of coping mechanism(starving myself, not sleeping at all, shutting everyone to solo my problems), it's always self destructive and spiraling down to a mental breakdown then suicidal. 


I don't know if this is the right decision, but I just wanted inner peace. I know it's harsher when it comes to working, and that not everyone will accept me in their companies or work, let alone in foreign countries, but I just wanted to make a decision where I can finally accept myself. 


I forced myself to go through college since if I don't, my family will abandon me, telling me to live by myself and that I'm ungrateful for them for providing me college tuition fees. Then they will keep comparing me to my cousins or themselves who have accomplished and achieved more than what I can. 


Please don't criticize me, I'm holding myself a lot to not end my life, I'm lost and I'm trying to get my shit together.

MentalHealthSupport,"(QUICK MESSAGE TO MODS)
-I mention marijuana and vyvanse in this post. I don’t know if it’s against the rules or not given that it’s mentioned strictly for information that would help explain my case a bit more and not suggesting them at all. I say this immediately so you can figure to delete the post or not.

(ACTUAL START OF POST)

Post traumatic Tics? (This is a remake/partial repost of a previous post for both help and additional information to this post) 

Also, trigger warning later in writing after stated.

Main Question: do any of you guys know anything about the possible existence of someone developing tics after traumatic experience(s)? 

I have never been diagnosed or talked to anyone but one person about possible trauma but I'm very confident it's trauma unless I try to invalidate myself. I match almost every single symptom of PTSD to extremity where it causes significant issues in my day to day life. I have had tics for at least 4 years but it was always very unoften. After experiencing something potentially traumatic, I started experiencing significantly more tics. The trauma started in last mid october but i only know that tics was a huge problem by January.  I have a hard time making a mental timeline of my symptoms with this.

I know i do take marijuana to help deal with trauma often (not unoften several times day) but i never experienced tics because of marijuana to my knowledge in the past before like some people do. I have had periods of time where I took marijuana a lot like I do at this point but didn't have these such heavy symptoms. (I have dealt and continue to deal with chronic depression and anxiety but those symptoms were never quite like the ones I speak of when I read the DSM-5 TR PTSD criteria and literature.)

My tics consist of random gasps for air, sudden jolts through my body like my shoulder makes a huge shrug or sometimes my whole upper body jolting. It varies and extremity and i notice that i compulsively tell myself to stop often when it happens. It often comes whenever i remember certain things or experience anxiety. Sometimes, I'll feel normal and all of a sudden it comes and sometimes l'm able to stop it, sometimes I fail for a long. It has gotten to the point where it's not so unoften for me to have rapid tics on repeat for long periods of time often while having panic attacks at the same time but it’s gotten better recently. It goes through waves like my mental health in general. I do find that closing my eyes and focusing on my breathing and general meditative practices help my anxiety and tics incredibly but it can often take a bit of time for it to subside substantially.

I'll add that I started taking Vyvanse not so long before (less than a month) the potentially traumatic events occurred and I've heard that people have developed tics from it but I only ever noticed some time following the events that I speak of.

Does anyone have any resources or anecdotal experience to help me understand all of this?

I read a case study about a young girl who dealt with something similar in a court case with her abusive father (something along the lines of that) but that's all l've seen so far.

Trauma dump / story-time for further, not needed information. 

TW SA : what happened was I experienced unintentional sexual assault by a person who was very dear to me and it repeated a few times. After the first time, I had reciprocated eventually after some lengthy period of time after feeling extremely uncomfortable and just wanting to do what they want (feeling too worthless to push against). I was also very unsure of what was happening since it was all largely non verbal and it wasn’t until that we talked about it after the third time that I realized that any of it was actually real. The SA: >! I had originally thought we were just hugging and she would start rubbing herself sexually against me. !< I genuinely questioned my sanity and if I imagined all of it. We would continue to have similar sexual encounters, her often starting them without verbal consent, but it would be a lot more mutual in terms of more obvious reciprocation I suppose. It would generally get better over time. I was not romantically acquainted with this person at all and had never expected them to do anything like that. They didn’t know why as well. We got together eventually after romantic feelings were mutually established. She had realized that she believes that she had feelings for me for a while before but was unaware. The relationship has been very stressful overall and I often have tics particularly around her, especially when it’s harder to distract myself around her given that I have to focus on her to some degree which can bring back extremely stressful things about the relationship in general. I generally avoid having them around her or anyone else. It’s harder to control around her or in very anxious situations. I do tend to be able to suppress my tics to where they’re less noticeable, unless I’m just imagining that they’re TICs and they’re not. I do deeply love her and she seems to love me and I don’t want to leave her anytime soon. I want to at least be able to not feel constantly stressed around her eventually, not so PTSD acting. I am generally able to repress it. I’m not saying a hell of a lot about the relationship currently so please don’t be so so quick to judge so deeply. We’ve talked about parts of these things in some depth but I generally avoid it. She’s quite apologetic for how everything started. We’re both quite neurodivergent and bad with social cues. Also, overtime, there was more and more verbal “consensual” agreements. I say all of this in case it somehow explains my case more.

I won't go into detail because it's absolutely disgusting, but, genuinely what the hell. I have no idea why I'm like this. As I've grown older it hasn't gotten any better. 

I've never had any sexual trauma, besides once when I was 17, and some online crap I got myself into at 15. But nothing as a child.

MentalHealthSupport,"I was starting to let go of the idea of love.
Of all my dreams about a beautiful wedding with the love of my life, having kids, and raising them with the man of my dreams. I started letting go of my Pinterest boards filled with visions of a future where I would give all my love to someone. I began planning a life for myself, full of traveling and self-love. I convinced myself I didn’t want kids, even though it had been a dream of mine since I was little. Slowly, I was letting go of everything I had ever wanted, simply because I hadn’t been treated right in past relationships.

I told myself I would date just to meet people and have more friends to hang out with. But then, one random Friday night, you came along and changed everything.

I hated it at first because I didn’t want someone to ruin my future plans. But little did I know, you made those dreams stronger than ever.

Before we ever met, you told me you didn’t want to hurt me. I was confused at the time, so I let it slide. Now, after everything, I understand what you meant.

We met that night at a bar and instantly connected. We were both full of anxiety, which made everything easier to talk about. I knew you were different from the start when I was just myself, without even noticing. We laughed, drank, played games, and had so much fun. That night didn’t feel like a typical date—it felt like a new beginning.

I didn’t want the night to end, so you came back to my place and stayed. That night made me believe in love again. It made me believe that people like you still exist. It reminded me that I am worthy of love.

But how can someone be so beneficial to you and yet break you at the same time?
Even though you made me feel like myself again, it came with a lot of pain. You were at a different stage in life, and that made it hard for us to build something lasting. You were fresh out of a serious, long-term relationship and wanted to experience your twenties.

You were doing what was best for you, and I happened to be in the middle of it. It drained me more than you could know. I was falling hard for you when, to you, I was just part of your journey of figuring out what you wanted in a partner. But you did it in such a respectful and mature way that I’m not angry. I was just foolish for letting myself fall for someone who I knew wasn’t ready.

Still, you treated me like no one else ever has, and I couldn’t help how I felt. You made me a better person, and I knew you were the one I wanted to give my all to. I’ll never apologize for that. The way I treated you was how you deserved to be treated. You deserve the world and more.

I just wish I could continue showing you that. Even though it hurts, I’ll always be your biggest cheerleader. I’ll love you from afar and pray that, maybe one day, it will be me and you in the end.

But for now, go live your life. You’ve spent so much time focusing on someone else; it’s time to focus on yourself.

Don’t ever change, because you are the most amazing person I’ve ever met, and I do not say that lightly.

For now, I will love you from afar.",Loving you from afar,1743699982.0,1jqnz12

MentalHealthSupport,"TW: SH

Hi so all my (21m) life I’ve been struggling with feeling like disconnected from reality in a way that I can’t explain to others, and untreated it is intensifying with each passing year and in response to each additional stressful event in my life especially in the past year. 

The feeling is very difficult even to myself describe but I’ll do my best. First off, it’s a feeling like I don’t really have any impact on the “physical-social-emotional” world so to speak. What’s important to clarify is that while these feelings have been described as depression, what I experience has never really been an issue of not believing in my potential. In fact for most of my life I’ve always had a pretty strong belief in myself and values and have seen potential in myself, that I just can’t seem to access because of my lack of life experience owing to various highly notable factors growing up and this involuntary pattern. I’ll have to consciously remind myself that I can do even simple things like change simple plans like taking a different route on a walk; I have no issue understanding those things cognitively, but it’s like reminding myself that I have any agency as a person, in a body, in the world, is something I have to consciously devote substantial energy to remind myself of. Like I’ll have a problem, and I’ll immediately recognize the solution, but there will feel like there is an unexplainable “block” from putting that solution into practice. 

Another thing is that oftentimes (to a moderate extent, *always*) the world feels somewhat surreal and dreamlike like I’m just observing it, which is sometimes paired with lessened sensory sensitivity (walking around in the humid summer, in a thick wool sweater, while not comprehending the music playing in my AirPods, is an example of the kind of stuff that I do while barely comprehending it). Perhaps the biggest issue with this tendency is the way it warps my sense of time and memory, like it feels so frustrating when I go to bed every night cause I’ll barely  remember big chunks of the door before, and it will have always felt like I didn’t do anything the day before. Likewise I’ll wake up with only the vaguest recollection of going to bed, or no memory at all. Sometimes I’ll wake up with the lights + the previous days clothes still on. 

I also have this annoying thing where I’ll have lots of free time but I just… won’t do anything with it. Like I may be interested in watching shows or listening to new music or playing a new game but those things just… don’t happen for reasons I can’t explain afterword. Thus I often feel like I’m lacking cultural knowledge because I just… don’t end up consuming media? Again my recollection of my free time is usually so hazy that after years of this pattern repeating daily I still can’t explain won’t happens that I just… don’t do things??? Another thing I’ll often end up doing getting caught in spirals of doing the same things repeatedly, but unlike what I hear about say ASD or OCD it’s not pleasant and voluntary. I don’t want to listen to the same songs over and over again, or use Reddit so much, or make impulse purchases, it’s super annoying and frustrating, but my “level of consciousness” is so low that I just… watch myself do that involuntarily. This is a common pattern, where there is something I want to do, or desire to stop doing, and for which doing or not doing is perfectly within the bounds of my cognitive abilities (as directly proven by the rare periods when I’m not disassociating!) but I just most of the time either feel like not processing what’s happening or feel like I’m just watching things happen. 

Finally I’ll often feel like I’m “not allowed” to do things in a subtle but disabling way, like I’m “not allowed” to use, for example, certain social medias cause they are for “normal people” (I feel this subconsciously) and I feel so othered by my past. Like I can scroll reddit for hours but if i go on Instagram I space out and close it without realizing it within a few minutes cause using it so stressful due to aforementioned association.

For reference I’ve recently come to understand the root of the dissociation as a response to extreme adverse childhood/adolescence events mixed with intense anxiety as a young child (for reference, I had frequent panic when young but hadn’t had that in years cause the dissociation is doing such a good job “””protecting”””me) which cause me to dissociate heavily so I don’t comprehend the severity of my past and thus feel the corresponding emotions but that knowledge doesn’t help me face it. 

I’ve also done a lot of therapy over the course of my life but it’s never been a modality that’s relevant to the root of my struggles which is this. I’ve been in therapy for years and I would always walk away from sessions either forgetting what it was I talked about because it felt so disconnected to what I was struggling with or actively feeling worse because the stuff discussed actively fed into this pattern (this was particularly prominent with the DBT/CBT stuff I did which just seemed to make me overthink this state even more, however my family was enamored with that form of therapy so I had to so it). 

From ages 15 to almost 20 (I’m 21 now) I was also on meds (Lexapro, Abilify, Concerta; Concerta probably being the worst of the 3) which seemed to further exacerbate this feeling but my family wouldn’t let go off them because they claimed that I “was doing so much better”. The feeling did improve after I quit meds; improve enough for me to see clearly that this feeling was taking away my entire life, but still powerless to do anything about it. Actually quitting meds caused an explosion in my emotional capacity, like all of sudden I enjoyed social interaction and wanted to champion empathy, whereas before I had been internally heartless, I also regained the ability to laugh for the first time in years) but this feeling is still stealing my life from me. 

However this relates to a cycle that has unfolded a few times since stopping meds. Basically things will continue to get better for in terms of social and academic progress which will have the effect of making me feel less and less developmentally scrambled, but as I become comfortable enough for the fog to begin dissipate I’ll come back into contact with my emotions, which will be great at first cause it feels like the real me is coming out, and I’ll feel intrinsically socially and academically motivated, however my emotions coming out also puts me contact with my negative, hopeless feelings, which causes me to shut down after a bit once I come face to face with the things which remind me of trauma. First with emotionally charged feelings of frustration and hopelessness, eventually giving way back to dissociation. I don’t mind feeling even sad (I’m still alive) but I’m honestly frightened that if this pattern keeps repeating eventually the real energetic, present, empathetic person within me, who I love, will become lost forever if my brain keeps relearning to disassociate. I don’t know if that’s possible but it’s scary and contributes to me valuing my emotions a lot.

In September 2024 a month into my 5th semester of college I chose to take a year off from school to do mental health work to process and overcome this tendency, because I recognized I wasn’t making academic progress or making any memories. However because my family has difficulty accepting this as my struggle (and I have difficulty explaining it) eventually after a month of deliberation (they also insisted on using a “consultant” that worked extremely slowly) I ended up having to go to a residential treatment center for young adults that while good for my social ability was irrelevant to what I was struggling with on a therapeutic level (it was behavioral and cognitive stuff, whereas considering my pattern I believe I would benefit from trauma processing). 

For a couple of months now I’ve been in a “transitional program” in which I’ve yet to make any process on studying or getting a job and have immediately regressed back into this overwhelming feeling of learned helplessness. Again I fully recognize how blessed I am to have such opportunities and I’m eternally thankful to my family and the universe for allowing me to have these opportunities that most will never have, so perhaps I’m just being spoiled, but I genuinely feel that my actual struggles are being ignored in favor others perceptions of my difficulties (i keep being told I have executive functioning issues one more time I will crash out it’s) and I’m so frustrated because I was so proud of my own decision to take a year off of college to do trauma work, in a family that was capable of providing such a thing for me, but it’s now less then 5 months until the start of the Fall college semester and i feel absolutely no closer to being a healed person ready to take advantage of my time in college. it’s very difficult to access my feelings through the fog but i know that the *real me*, buried somewhere inside my soul, is crying right now with frustration.

I also 3 weeks ago tried EMDR therapy for the first time in my life and my 3 sessions have been a totally different therapeutic experience than I’ve ever had. In the exercises and in my conversations with the therapist I actually felt like I was getting somewhere with the roots of these feelings. Which just reaffirms my feeling that I have a trauma psychology. And this feeling has become so inescapable that a few day ago I honestly self harmed just due to how surreal a felt and honestly it oddly didn’t really bother me although looking at the scars on my arm is grounding. I have before a year ago but that was during one of the previous rare periods of emotional release, whereas this was generated from sheer numbness.",Difficulty explaining that I don’t have full free will due to my disassociation,1743715714.0,1jqutbj

Last year for all of us really sucked in multiple ways and the result coming out of it all was one of my friends being diagnosed with depression. We all try to support each other as best we can but our group hasn't been able to get together as much because of conflicting schedules. 

The friend who now has depression hasn't been working on things they normally do and for some dumb reason my brain has stuck onto the idea that they're doing terribly. Which I've actually heard they're doing better from their husband and from their mouth. They're now on antidepressants that have helped them immensely. But still my brain CANNOT let go of the idea that they are drowning in their depression or on the verge of doing something drastic. Which I frankly don't have any evidence for. They have talked about their future with me mutiple times but any joke or negative connotation is met with immense overwhelming anxiety in my mind.

My brain constantly thinks about them and how they're doing bad and how they're gonna do this and I don't wanna deal with another tragedy in my life and and and... it's been causing me an insurmountable amount of anxiety. I've tried deep breathing, hanging out with them, checking on them, mediation, journaling, talking to others about it, distracting myself and more but STILL.... the stupid anxiety of it will. Not.

I realized my mistake and took full responsibility for it, apologised to her as I should have and told her that this will never happen again

She promised me that this won't effect our friendship and she would be there for me in my hard times if I maintained the appropriate distance and I did just that

MentalHealthSupport,"Greetings.  
Well... I really don't know how to express this, but I’ve reached a point where my intrusive thoughts are just fucking me up. So, this piece of shit is trying to ask for support for the first time in his life. Hopefully it won’t be that long.

I’m 19, never worked, and I’m just a college student. I want absolutely nothing. I’m stuck in a career I don’t care about — Tourism — and to be honest, I don’t like anything at all. I'm only here because I'm not smart enough for engineering or medicine. I ended up in this career because I kind of speak English (my native language is Spanish)… and that’s it.

I used to have hobbies. Drawing, video games… but none of it feels the same anymore. I’m not interested in anything. The only thing that brings me a bit of “satisfaction” is using AI, since I don’t really have anyone. I don’t trust my parents either — mental health is “bullshit” to them. They’re not bad people, but it’s impossible to talk to them about this. If I told them I had no goals or motivation, they wouldn’t take it well.

My father, in particular, believes I want to become some great professional, with money, a wife, kids, a car… and I just don’t care about any of that. He’s always pushing me to “get out of my bubble,” go to networking events, participate in whatever random college activities he finds online. The problem is… I don’t care about any of it. I’m not a social person — I can talk to people just fine, but I don’t like taking the first step. I feel more comfortable being alone. But to him, that’s not acceptable. 

Today he brought it up again. And it just felt like another weight on my back. I already get home late, and I still have homework that keeps me up past midnight. It’s a two-hour trip back and forth that’s a chunk of my day gone. How am I supposed to add more to that?

Tourism wasn’t even my first choice. First, I tried Systems Engineering (forced by him) and that was the worst semester of my life. Watching my classmates move ahead while I failed five subjects made me feel like an idiot. Like I’m just wasting my parents’ money.

Then I tried a virtual university, studying Barchelors degree in languages. But my dad kept criticizing it. Eventually, he found another school thanks to the help of another person, and I picked literally *anything* I thought I could survive in. Not what I wanted  just what might work. Like he was just pointing at me with a gun to pick up something and leave the other career behind.

I don’t have any genuine friends to talk to. And even when I “accomplish” something, it feels empty. Compliments don’t mean anything to me anymore.

Right now, I just feel like I’m dead inside. I always try my best but sometimes it feels like it isn't enough, and i end up feeling like i'm not good enough at all.  
I don’t even know if this is something I should be worried about. Maybe I’m just being childish. I really don’t know. I’ve never talked about this before.

Travel and see a world that will slowly not exist anymore and that i will just forget? Run around like an ant making no impact on anything? Go to college and get a degree so that I can be locked away in some building somewhere just so I can make money that is simply just worthless scraps of paper?

MentalHealthSupport,Growing up I didn't have friends in my previous school after 6th grade I went to a new school hoping things will be different only to end up having the worst friendship ever. Me and her became best friends instantly and whenever I am mad at her she will say so many things just to make things good between us so I was so happy. After a while things changed she started hanging out with the topper and I was the second of the class. I didn't mind since the topper was also my friend but she made my friend completely a different person. When they are talking I would go and try to attend the conversation only to get ignored by my best friend and the topper says like oh look it's Ur best friend talk with her and giggle with sarcasm. Idk why idk since when she started being like that but since it was my first good friendship it felt so sad and when I go and try to talk to her one day she ran out of there saying she is going to the bathroom once or she will just ignore and let me stand there awkward till leave. After that I found it really difficult to make friends I didn't really get along with anyone easily it felt like no one is meant to be my friend but after a while a girl came to my tuition class and surprisingly we got along well I was very happy cuz I rarely get along with someone. And she became my best friend but then she stopped coming to the tuition class and someone told me that she is going to another tuition class instead. I hoped that she will tell me at least but guess I was just a nobody to her. Fast forward to now after 4 years I finally found some friends in my school. Actually it is a friend group two are in my class other two R in different classes. When the two that are in my class are talking I normally don't interrupt them since I am afraid that they will ignore me and I will feel like a loser and awkward. But they have been good to me they even begged telling me that I should come to the school trip so I thought maybe they are different but recently one of the friends that are in my class ignores me on purposely she looks at me with a side eye and looks away I thought maybe it is how she is cuz she is different in other times talking with me and laughing sometimes but I realised that is only when others aren't around. She also talk well with me when she needs help with something.So I told this to a another friend of the friend group that isn't in our class. She told me that she did the same thing to her too. ( Giving side eye and ignoring) She also said that if she did that again I should ignore her too. To her maybe I am nobody so she won't even have a problem if I ignore but she is one of the two friends I have in my class. And she mostly talks with the other friend in my class so I will be left alone in the class again. Idk if I am just overthinking and it is just how she is or she doesn't like me.

Im nineteen I’ve been working full time for a couple of years now and my job has absolutely drained me, I hate it too so so much I hate the management, the values they hide behind, the bullying I’ve gone through by ADULTS just to protect the clients I support, only to be faced by the company brushing EVERYTHING under the fkn rug and silencing me 

I’m trying to find another job but everyone knows that who I’m with is the highest paying in the region. I don’t qualify for benefits because I earn too much YET I’m struggling so hard. I budget like crazy I don’t own any girly things to make myself feel like an individual. I pay 400-1500 in tax every fortnight and it drives me crazy because I work my ass off and it just feels like financially I’m walking in a circle 

I have no friends where I live, it’s a retirement town basically. Every time I do come across an opportunity for a friend there’s ALWAYS an expectation of having to message them online constantly. I don’t want to do that man, ofc check ins and sharing exciting news but god when I get home I just want to shower and eat and go to bed, and that’s normally all I have time for. Other people my age just don’t get it. We live in two entirely different worlds. - I do go to regular hobbies/clubs and have tried joining activities and shi but no it hasnt helped especially as I came in when the friend circles were already made

I can’t call my house a home, it’s just all the necessities in one spot that thankfully is warm. My room is bare, it has a bed, a dresser and a lamp. nothing else. My kitchen has carpet in it and I just frown everytime I look at it it’s so unhygienic not to mention embarrassing to have people over 

I’m trying desperately to leave this town to a city that I know I’ll find so much joy in but the living crisis is getting scary and I don’t have enough to move anytime soon and am very worried about covering rent in the city. 

The mental health system is set up for everyone to fail, I have used all my work funded counselling this year, my gp ones and I’m now going through another company for counselling but again I only get a maximum amount of sessions, six. I’m over doing the whole introduction shi with every new therapist and by the time I’m comfortable with them to share, thats all my sessions gone 

I don’t know what to do I don’t know how to move forward, I’m so over everything and it’s coming into winter now so everything’s going to be more dark and cold and depressing

For keeping my privacy I am not going to introduce myself on a deeper level. 

Currently I'm 21 years old suffering with anxiety, depression and ADHD.

I've been undiagnosed my whole life which made my life a bit harder.

I was doing bad things to my health (I don't want to specify it because I don't want to trigger anyone).

I started smoking when I was 17 or 18.
It helped me a lot (I am not supporting smoking) and got addicted to smoking.

Years passed and I realised I can have a better way to feel good. So I quit smoking and with the saved money from smoking I'm going to buy myself a dog. (For emotional support)

Quitting smoking is not easy.. and so is every addiction. I've been battling with 1 more thing but like I said I don't want to trigger anyone. I stopped that too.

I take my meds every day and been to therapy many times now. Going to hospital for a month in the near future. And you know what? I'm excited. Because it's going to help me and I will be able to get even better.

I tried to “pull myself together”, force myself to work, find motivation, but it only got worse.

Things started to change when I realized: depression is not something that just goes away on its own. It's a condition that you can work with, but it takes specific steps.

Here's what helped me:

Stop and recognize that I have a problem, rather than trying to ignore it.

Small victories: doing something minimal (cleaning up, going outside), and documenting that I did it.

Conversations with people who weren't trying to “just motivate me” but really understood what it was.

MentalHealthSupport,"I thought healing would be enough. I thought that if I just learned how to love myself, I’d stop feeling so empty, so unworthy, so anchorless. And I have done the work. I do love myself now. But I’m still miserable. For the longest time, I thought that meant I wasn’t healing right. That maybe I was just being dramatic. Too much. Too needy. Too broken. But now I see something I couldn’t before. I’ve stumbled on a truth that feels like a key I’ve been searching for in the dark.
I’ve been trying to survive without one of the most essential things a human being needs, connection. Not the superficial kind. Not presence without presence. But real connection. Love. Acceptance. Belonging. Empathy. Understanding. Affection. Intimacy. Appreciation. Respect. Resonance. These aren’t luxuries. They’re not rewards you earn by being better or less complicated. They are basic human needs, as vital as food and air.
I have  been struggling with a deep, aching sense of disconnection. I feel like I’m floating through life without an anchor. The last few weeks have been especially difficult. I started reading Attached, and it helped me put words to something I’ve always felt but couldn’t quite explain. I realized it wasn’t just a me thing. I lack a secure base, the deep knowing that someone is there for you without question, someone you can turn to in times of need. When we are unsure whether the people closest to us truly support us, believe in us, and will be there when it really matters, it becomes nearly impossible to stay grounded. Life starts to unravel. Focus slips. Hope thins. For many, this secure base starts with our parents and becomes our partners as we grow older.

Both of my parents were abusive and neglectful when I was growing up. My dad disappeared two years ago, and I just recently reconnected with my mother. Neither of them has ever worked through their own trauma. There has never been a foundation of emotional safety for me to lean on.
I’ve been single for two long, grueling years, working hard on myself. And no matter how much inner healing I’ve done, I haven’t been able to rid myself of the desperate longing to be seen, to be held, to feel safe with someone. The absence of that security, the absence of someone who shows up unequivocally, has pushed me to the edge more times than I can count. It is what makes life feel too heavy, what makes living feel like too much. And now I finally understand, it’s not because I’m dramatic. It’s because I’m human.

Emotional safety is not optional. It’s not something we can live without and still be okay. We are not meant to heal in isolation. We are not meant to live unseen, untouched, or unloved. Without a secure base, I’ve been walking through life with no steady ground, no one I can count on unconditionally. No one who believes in me without hesitation. No one who sees me not as a burden, but as someone worth standing beside when the world goes dark.

And it’s not just about having someone there, it’s about how they’re there. I’ve clung to people who, even after I honestly and vulnerably explained that their way of showing support wasn’t helping, chose not to listen. Instead, they defended their actions, rather than asking why it wasn’t reaching me. But the truth is, good intentions do not guarantee a positive impact. If someone tells you the way you are showing up isn’t helping them, and you truly care, you listen. You don’t have to get it perfect. You just have to care enough to try. That is what love looks like. That is what support means. That is what being human should be.
It breaks my heart how rare it is to experience that kind of care, how difficult it is for people to give one another the most basic forms of decency. I’m not saying this to place blame. I’m saying it because it’s true, and because the consequences are real. Every day, people lose their lives because these needs go unmet.
This isn’t just sadness. This is need. And no, I’m not too much. I’m not broken, or dramatic, or needy. I’m human. And I’m done pretending I can thrive without connection. 

You cannot heal away fundamental needs. And it’s cruel that our society expects the people who are hurting and dying to be the ones to do the impossible and never think of asking why the people in their life are failing to meet their needs.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi all, good day,

I’m 36 and have been married for 7 years. During my 20s-30s, I was sexually active with ex-partners and never experienced erection/climax issues. Before marriage, I didn’t have intercourse with my inexperienced wife.

In contrast, I had been involved with more experienced partners/prostitutes before marriage, which heightened my sexual expectations. My wife was hesitant and timid about sex, which made intimacy challenging. During this time + currently, I rely heavily on masturbation and pornography (averaging twice daily), which has since escalated to rough contents (scat, spy etc...).

Over time, my wife and I developed better communication about sex, including watching porn together and discussing kinks. She is a wonderful partner, and we now want to start a family. However, I struggle with sexual attraction toward her and often need to think about past partners or fantasies to feel aroused. She knows this. We spoke about our gaps on intimacy and want to start fresh.

I also find it difficult to climax during intercourse with her, though she says she enjoys our intimacy. I suspect my pornography consumption may have impacted my libido or performance. We use sex toys, lubes etc, but I never get that lovely feeling like I had with others.

I’m seeking advice on how to rebuild sexual attraction toward my wife and improve our intimacy while addressing these challenges.",Depressed due to unsatisfied sexual experience with wife.,1743640441.0,1jq4lcg
MentalHealthSupport,"I thought healing would be enough. I thought that if I just learned how to love myself, I’d stop feeling so empty, so unworthy, so anchorless. And I have done the work. I do love myself now. But I’m still miserable. For the longest time, I thought that meant I wasn’t healing right. That maybe I was just being dramatic. Too much. Too needy. Too broken. But now I see something I couldn’t before. I’ve stumbled on a truth that feels like a key I’ve been searching for in the dark.
I’ve been trying to survive without one of the most essential things a human being needs, connection. Not the superficial kind. Not presence without presence. But real connection. Love. Acceptance. Belonging. Empathy. Understanding. Affection. Intimacy. Appreciation. Respect. Resonance. These aren’t luxuries. They’re not rewards you earn by being better or less complicated. They are basic human needs, as vital as food and air.
I have  been struggling with a deep, aching sense of disconnection. I feel like I’m floating through life without an anchor. The last few weeks have been especially difficult. I started reading Attached, and it helped me put words to something I’ve always felt but couldn’t quite explain. I realized it wasn’t just a me thing. I lack a secure base, the deep knowing that someone is there for you without question, someone you can turn to in times of need.

MentalHealthSupport,"Walk away.

Walk away with all the love you have for yourself. They might be the right person at the wrong time—but if it’s the wrong time, then it’s still wrong. That’s what you have to realize. Hold your head high and remind yourself: It will be okay.

Telling yourself it will be okay is easier said than done. You’ll think about them constantly. Everything will remind you of them. A scent, a song, a place—it will all pull you back to the memories they left behind. Your heart will ache for them. Their words will echo in your mind. You’ll crave their touch.

But this is just a chapter in your life—one that’s teaching you the most important lesson: how to love yourself enough to walk away.

Walk away from the love they aren’t ready to receive.
Walk away from the endless need for reassurance.
Walk away from the “what ifs.”

Let go. Let yourself heal. Let yourself grow into the woman who will one day look back and think, “Why did I ever allow myself to stay in that place?”

Focus on what you have instead of what you’ve lost. You have yourself. You have friends, family, and God. You don’t need someone who isn’t ready to be loved by a woman who gives her all.

Walk away and let go.

One day, you’ll understand why this had to happen. You’ll see whether they were truly the right person at the wrong time—or just a lesson from God. If it was a lesson, learn from it. Carry that wisdom forward. Because the love that is meant for you will never need to be chased.

Let go. Walk away. And trust that what’s ahead is greater than what you’re leaving behind.",What Must You Do When Someone Is not Ready To Be With You,1743627715.0,1jpzqte
MentalHealthSupport,"Hello everyone and thank you for helping me on my self-improvement journey. Firstly i want to apologize for possible mistakes in this text, i am not a native english speaker and I'd like to ask you for constructive criticism and decent answers, I'm trying to find valid sources that have really helped some people with similar problems. Professionals opinions are welcomed! i will start with my background - I am a 21 year old slavic girl who is going through her 2nd year of bachelor studies in some sort of healthcare science (unrelated right now). 

My childhood wasnt the nicest. I dont remember much, but i can tell you what i do. My parents got divorced when i was just a baby and both remarried and had other kids. My mom didnt have the best taste in men, so i ended up mentally abused by her ex husband and i had to witness domestic violence through my childhood, while trying to protect my little sister (his daughter) from seeing how dysfunctional we were at that time. I was used to listen to constant shouting, arguing, threads, humiliation and accusations in this household. I was the person my mom talked with about her problems, i was the one who was trying to convince her to leave when i saw new bruises on her, but we always had to get back. She didnt care much about what i do or how i feel, how hurt or exhausted i was from this life. When i needed something she had her own problems or she paid attention just to my little sister. She wasnt much in her mom role in those years, it was just me. My dad also remarried and had kids. I wouldnt ever say that he doesnt love me, he more like doesnt get it. At first i was visiting his house every other weekend, but with time he stopped losing interest in reaching out to me, so we went for weeks without seeing each other to eventually even months. Since i was like fifteen he says that its my duty to try to be in their life, he wont call by himself or even invite me to birthdays (and then its my fault i dont show up even though i didnt know), he just isnt interested. He has his own family and i get it, what makes me sad is the thing that he says that its not true. My mom also has her own kids and i can see i never belonged to any of these families even though i tried my best. I was always shy bookworm, i was scared to talk and i had problems socializing with kids my age. After my mom got divorced (and it was a nasty one) i started taking antidepressants (i was 12/13). I became so numb and from already confused girl became total weirdo with loads of anxiety, panic attacks and depression. I even did whole high school from home because i wasnt okay. I didnt know or understood myself, dated badly, had messed emotions and did everything to be liked. I didnt have many friends and my honesty and nerdy interests didnt help that at all. These things were frustrating as hell

Last year something in me clicked. I was in university, trying to work and study and live normally, but then i figure out i dont know who i am. I broke up with my passive boyfriend, got out of antidepressants and birth control. And i was like - i dont have any hobbies, i dont know what i like, i dont remember much about myself. My short and long term memory is almost non existent, i cant focus or think logically. Social skills are terrible too. I am still much number than other people, still like i have bubbly foil around myself, but i can feel. I met someone who made me feel much more and that person is a big part of my motivation. I want to work on my anxiety, lack of self-worth and confidence, overthinking, my nonability to feel fully. I want to know what i really like. I am trying working out currently for all of the benefits it can bring and my friend (who is also a PT) saw that i had problems with feeling that burning pain when lifting and that i am on the edge of breakdown when i lift, so we talked and agreed that i am really disconnected from my body and myself in general. He recommended me this book Trauma and soul by D. Kalsched and i am so looking forward to make myself better. 

So please people of reddit, do you have book/yt/blog/podcast recommendations or any other valuable advice for me? I take everything, i am so eager to evolve myself because this world deserves better me.

I will add more posts about this topic in future, so people who are in similar position stay tuned! we are not lost and we deserve better <3","Criticize me, recommend me, help me improve my life! How to reconnect with myself?",1743630137.0,1jq0q9o

I am currently 22 and  studying in university.
 
I've been struggling with severe depression for years now and it affects every aspect of my life and is so insanely soul crushing. I'm especially destroyed by the loneliness, I'm unable to talk to people and have essentially no friends (I've been this way for a long time and there's no quick way for me to make friends. Not looking for help in this department). Anyways the main point is I feel a lot of my pain comes from my loneliness .  (Also I've been on medication for ~7 years now and have tried every one in the book and am currently on a cocktail of 3 different ones right now, but it's never been enough.)

It feels almost every week I'm fighting off suicidal thoughts, but overtime it's gotten harder and harder. Every aspect of my life suffers because of these feelings.

I genuinely believe with my whole heart that if I had an emotional support animal, it would make the world of a difference. Just having a creature to take care of, something so I'm not alone, a creature who I can love and interact with who will love and interact with me. I have been able to get pet mice and they make a world of a difference, maybe the only reason I'm still around. But unfortunately they very much are prey and although a few of them tolerate me and even like playing with my hand, theyre a far cry from an emotional support animal.

I absolutely qualify for one where I live. But here is the tricky part:

The house I live in is a student house,which my dad owns (so I only pay half rent). But because of that the landlord tenant agreement doesn't hold. And so if I did get a pet without his approval, he would kick me out. ( In my city rent for a room in a student house could be ~$700-1500) And so, that is obviously not worth it.

But my dad is not heartless, I think if he knew how lonely I felt, and that having a cat or another support animal would make me feel better he would understand.

However the last thing I want to do is tell my parents I feel this way. It will only make me feel worse. They have an idea about it as they know about the medications I'm on, but I always play it off and say it's mainly anxiety and nothing to worry about.

I really do not want to tell them how desperately alone I feel. Knowing them they will blame themselves and go out of their way to support me which would make me feel even worse and more like a burden so I am so incredibly hesitant upon doing that.

How can I go about talking to my dad about my need for an emotional support animal without:

a) seeming like I'm using it as an excuse to get a pet

b) open up entirely and change our relationship forever

MentalHealthSupport,"I (19f) have struggled my entire life with some form of mental illness. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything really, just the typical lazy depression and anxiety diagnosis. Which yes I do experience some of those symptoms but it’s not really the root of the problem. But nonetheless, it’s completely destroyed all hope I have for a normal life. It started very early family would always point out strange behaviors. For instance I could not connect with any of my peers, it took me till I was 18 to have a real friendship. I’ve always been a very strange girl, I’ve been described as an odd and uncomfortable presence ever since I could remember. I went through extreme bullying and abuse as a result of these problems, that eventually escalated into assau1t at the age of 7. I could never understand why I was so peculiar, as I grew older and was faced with more abuse/challenges from unfortunate circumstances it somehow caused a complete disconnection from some of my emotions. Empathy and joy being the main ones I lack, I have extreme paranoia about myself and rarely leave the house out of fear people will be able to detect my lack of humanity. It’s completely debilitating, I feel constant boredom and guilt it’s rare that anything can trigger an emotional response. The only thing that makes me feel any sort of connection to the world around me is honestly when I’m useful if that makes sense. I feel like when I’m of use to others it gives my pointless existence some form of peace. I’m just very tired of feeling like a waste of space or something foreign pathetically impersonating a human.

Now, i am perfectly fine going off the thinners to do the biopsy. I want it done ASAP but my endocrinologist is fighting me. I can't even change endos because my Healthcare is through the VA.

He wants me to wait until I've got more information to give than ""i may have thyroid cancer. This is what they have found some far through ultrasound.""

MentalHealthSupport,"I (F22) was clinically diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in 2023 after an assessment at a psych center near my home. Therapy was recommended, with medication as a backup if therapy didn’t help. At the time, I wanted to manage things on my own—journaling, watching TEDx talks, and diving into self-help videos. Surprisingly, what helped me the most was moving out to a different city for almost a year to finish my studies.

But when I moved back home, everything I had managed to keep under control started unraveling again. It feels like my family is suffocating me. The abuse, the disrespect, the violence, the narcissism, and the closed-mindedness—I just can’t take it. And then, just a few months later, we moved to a different country to live with my grandmother, who has been a major source of my mental distress since childhood. Her words and actions have tormented me for years, and now I have to live under the same roof as her again.

I recently overheard my family talking about taking me somewhere for a consultation, but I’m terrified. I don’t think they understand what I actually need, and I’m afraid to tell them that the real problem is being around them.

When I was 6/7 years old I was sa’d by a boy in my class. I haven’t fully remembered it yet because I’m scared to but I know it happened and how bad I felt at the time. It was a lot more than what I did to my brother, we hid under tables during lunch, making out multiple times, I think I agreed at first but it became much more. I remember feeling stuck/frozen at the time and I’m not sure how many times it happened, I know I never told anyone though.

When I was either 9 or 10, I was outside playing truth or dare with my brother who was 4 or 5. I dared him to let me kiss him and he said no. I proceeded to ask a few more times please (I don’t know how many times and I’m not sure but I might have offered to give him all of my toys) and he kept saying no. I didn’t want him to do anything he didn’t want to and my goal wasn’t to make him say yes. I remember not wanting to do anything at all just that I felt like I had to, I didn’t think at all that it was wrong or could hurt him, just that I was being annoying. I did care about his feelings and didn’t want to hurt him at all, I was very confused and didn’t understand what I was doing, If I knew it was wrong at the time I wouldn’t have brought the idea up whatsoever. I soon realised I should stop asking and that I really didn’t have to do anything so I walked away to go back inside the house. He then said wait and that he’d changed his mind. I was hesitant but because I didn’t realise that he was most likely pressured and that’s why he agreed I didn’t think of it as a big deal so I quickly kissed him on the lips. I felt and still feel so disgusted thinking about it even though it didn’t happen again and didn’t go any further than a peck. I didn’t tell him not to tell anyone/threaten him and I don’t think I tried to make it seem like a secret at all. I believe this all happened because of what happened to me, I’m not saying this is an excuse at all just an explanation.

Immediately afterwards he went and told our mum that I kissed him. She asked him if he was okay and he assured her he was, just that he was confused why I’d want a kiss. She came and asked me about it and I remember feeling very stressed like I was about to cry even though she told me everything was okay. I was confused and assumed I’d done something wrong (which I did) just because she was asking me, otherwise why would she? I was angry often because my mum would always take my brother’s side over mine because he’s the youngest so It felt like that for me. He’s 13 now and remembers what happened clearly and still says he’s fine with what happened and wasn’t hurt. I know he could still be hurt and realise this once he’s older, if so how could I help him?

I don’t know what to do, I forgot about this for a while because other people on Reddit have told me it wasn’t cocsa but I used ai bots to ask about the incident which said it most likely was. I don’t want to victimise myself, I just need to know the truth and if I should kill myself or not. I’ve already asked my brother about the event multiple times because I have ocd and people convinced me that it wasn’t harmful so I didn’t think it would matter that I did ask him about it.

Does anyone think my brother could be harmed from this? My mum and him really don’t think so and he thinks I’m making a big deal out of nothing but I don’t think I’ll be able to live with myself if he really was.

MentalHealthSupport,"I moved out of my mom’s when I was 14-15 because she was having a really bad schizophrenic episode. My dad and her got divorced and she took us away to live somewhere else until she got sick and it became impossible for me to live her. My dad was really depressed and dwelled on his sister’s family’s help during that time until I moved in with him. The sister’s daughter (my cousin) received a lot of money from my dad for studying aboard in her 20s, my dad gave her A LOT of money. She then claimed herself as this Ivy League business graduate genius to get more money from my dad, saying that she knows a lot of famous ppl, got a business going on about some carbon footprint bullshit and my dad genuinely believed her and had set her up as a role model for me to follow. He poured in a lot of energy and time and even called her as his “second daughter”. He was never really around when I was little, I was brought up mostly by mom. I have my troubled past but honestly before graduation I would just be glad if the place I stayed in isn’t violent because for most of my childhood they were, that’s why I really like my boarding school, it felt more like home to me than anywhere else.

But back to it basically during my freshmen year I found out that the cousin was just trying to scam my family. She just can’t get enough and I figured it out before my dad. I told him and at first he found it hard to believe, but then he realized it’s all a scam and then he started to ask me for help. He doesn’t know a lot of English and wanted me to be his interpreter but I literally couldn’t take this. I know it’s a lot of money but the whole thing really just shattered my definition of trust and it really was a lot of money (like around $2m). Police got involved and she even tried to get herself pregnant just to avoid getting arrested. The event affected me a lot throughout my uni years and now I’m almost graduating. I had a lot of mental health issues and suicidal thoughts I kept telling my dad I can’t do it, I can’t do it anymore. But to me it seems like he doesn’t really care, he would get mad if I don’t get him the information and I felt like he just kept using me. When I was back home he took me to the hospital to get another diagnosis of my mental health condition (I’ve done it before but in another country) because that would be useful evidence for him to use against her in court. I felt used this whole time. And when he gets really mad (sometimes I will be stubborn as well because I don’t want to follow whatever he says) he will use money to threaten me. I don’t know how much he means it. 

I know life is definitely hard for him as well. I don’t know how to feel and I think it fucks up my value system and how I would form relationship with others. I became dismissive and avoidant in relationships. I don’t know. I think I really just feel lost and I can’t be bothered to think about him, or anyone anymore.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi, sorry this is an alt because I'm not anonymous on my usual account.



I'm sixteen and I may have emerging BPD. Though I am very aware that BPD is almost always diagnosed in people above the age of eighteen, I have developed very persistent traits that I have only recently (maybe a few months ago) found out that align quite well with BPD traits and was just wondering whether some of my experiences could perhaps constitute that of someone who has BPD or if it can be considered trauma. All of the things I will mention have happened to me before I was 15 essentially.



\- Constant emotional invalidation by primary caretaker (Examples: Whenever I apologised for something minor eg. being 5-10 minutes late when they came to pick me up due to various reasons they would shout and tell me that my apologies did not mean anything. Whenever I cried as a kid (I mostly remember this happening when I was 10-12 I think) my primary caretaker would tell me that they found it amusing how I was so shameless that I could cry when I was the one that was being a burden. etc)



\- I only have one parent who is my primary caretaker, the other parent is absent so this person is practically all I have



\- Primary caretaker told me that they want to suicide every single day



\- I was very paranoid throughout my entire childhood (4-15) and thought that my primary caretaker was going to leave me so I constantly asked if they still loved me and they ridiculed me for that, so I stopped and tried to detach myself from the situation. I would also hypothesise or conclude that my parent may have died in some sort of accident if I don't see them for a while or if they returned from work late which is sort of an unusual thought framework for like a 7-11 year old?



\- I feel unable to express any negative emotion in front of any of my family members, especially my primary caretaker. I am always stoic in front of them, I don't really understand but I learnt from quite a young age from subconscious environmental factors that it was not safe to be sad or angry in my household.



\- I was constantly compared, belittled, and also made to feel like I'm inconveniencing everyone around me due to most likely having undiagnosed ADHD (I have done so, so many hours of research on this. I do not self dx) that I am still unable to get a diagnosis on which has been really, really difficult. My caretaker brought me to a pediatrician who concluded that I could not have ADHD since I was so smart and got good grades.



\- I was physically hit a bit (hit, kicked, slapped when things got out of hand) as a kid by my primary caretaker. They also smashed things out of rage which makes me think that they could have benefited from some professional help too (eg. my phone, cups, chinaware.)



Could this be traumatic or am I overthinking it?



(Additionally, at 16 I now have an intense fear of abandonment in almost all of my relationships, I sh and have done quite messed up things like trauma dumping on some of my older friends/begging them not to leave by using sh, feel empty whenever I'm alone, have had clear patterns of idealisation and devaluing and I always thought it was limerence but I have been very affected by having a 'favourite person' to the point it is obsessive, probably toxic or slightly manipulative on my end and I am self-aware, I have no idea who I am and my sense of self is almost completely just built around how other people treat me, I have an intolerance of being alone, I am quite impulsive, I have an ED which may have stemmed from this and I have experienced dissociation, and I think if I tried to look at my relationship dynamics with others objectively I have done many messed up things out of a fear of abandonment, including repeatedly testing to see if they'll leave and demanding attention and things that have been too much for many people. Most of these things have bene happening before I realised that I may have some BPD traits and I am aware that I guess some of these can be attributed to hormones??)

MentalHealthSupport,"Last year was incredibly difficult for me. I found myself crying constantly, struggling to cope with the uncertainty in my life. My distress started when I felt threatened to lose my job at my previous workplace. At the same time, I had set my heart on securing a job in a different city—somewhere close to my boyfriend, where I had envisioned building my future. When I applied for a position there and didn’t succeed, I was devastated. I couldn’t stop thinking about the future—how to establish a stable career, how to afford a house, and most of all, how to be with my boyfriend. Every time I visited him and had to leave, I would break down in tears. This cycle of anxiety and sadness lasted for months.

Then, unexpectedly, I received a call about a job offer. Ironically, it wasn’t a job I truly wanted—I had applied only for the sake of applying. Every stage of the hiring process felt forced because, deep down, I wasn’t invested in it. I wanted to work in that other city, to be near my boyfriend, to start making concrete plans for our future. But my boyfriend encouraged me to go through the process anyway.

Even after that, my anxiety didn’t stop. I was still consumed by fear—what if I ended up unemployed? It reached a point where I couldn’t function properly at home, and I often stayed at my aunt’s house just to cope. Then came another surprise—I got a call from the superintendent offering me the job. It was permanent, which meant stability, and despite my initial reluctance, I accepted it because I knew how important security was. At first, I felt optimistic because I was assigned to a unit that was familiar to me after working at my previous workplace. The transition felt natural, and for the first few weeks, I felt comfortable.

But everything changed when the superintendent was replaced. I was suddenly reassigned to a school as an Administrative Officer, responsible for all administrative tasks. I had no experience in this role, and the transition was overwhelming. Worse, there was no proper orientation or guidance—I had to figure everything out on my own. Whenever I tried to express my struggles, I was met with invalidating responses like, It felt like every time I tried to seek support, my struggles were dismissed as just another competition of who had it worse.

I tried to advocate for myself by requesting a reassignment back to my original unit, but my request was rejected. When I brought it up with my supervisor, I was scolded instead. Feeling unheard, I decided to keep my head down and just push through. But now, my biggest challenge is dealing with my current principal. He is undeniably competent, but he is also extremely demanding. The pressure is immense, and it has drained me completely. I wake up every morning with a heavy chest, my heart pounding loudly. I feel anxious just thinking about work, and there are days when I can’t bring myself to go at all. I hate my job, I hate my boss, and I hate myself for feeling this way—because I know I should be grateful. I prayed so hard for job security, and now that I have it, I despise what it has become.

Adding to this anxiety is my concern for my boyfriend. Now that I have a permanent job, I want him to have one too, so that we can build our future together. But I’m scared—unlike me, he hasn’t had the same stroke of luck. He’s currently working at a university, but he’s already unhappy and considering quitting. A part of me doesn’t want him to, because I know how difficult it is to find another stable job. And if he ends up unemployed, what does that mean for our future? I want us to have a house of our own, a stable life, but how can we achieve that if I’m the only one with job security?

I am aware of my tendency toward black-and-white thinking, and I know how negative it is—but I don’t know how to stop. My thoughts feel like they’re running in circles, and I can’t seem to break free from this overwhelming anxiety.

Over time, I have been able to feel a little better. I even became closer to my aunts, which helped in some ways. But no matter what I do, my anxiety about my job and my future still consumes me. I don’t think the Fluoxetine and antipsychotics are working anymore. While they have helped me control my emotional outbursts, I still feel extremely anxious and depressed. What should I do? Should I consider a different medication? If so, what would be the best option for me?",Help me;,1743664339.0,1jqbxeo

Now she just uses words as her weapon but the next moment shes so so loving it confuses me it feels worse than getting hit tbh at least i would feel kinda justified for feeling like absolute piece of shit but i dont know how to feel when that happens its almost as if shes a different person sometimes maybe she did all that for my own good at least thats what she says always as its a common method used in my region to discipline kids but i discovered after talking with my friends that majority of them werent hit or were once or twice throughout their entire lives which did catch me off guard.

But after my mom stopped it really feels weird now i wrote this in my journal after the inexplicable feeling-
It’s unfathomable how my mother’s touch felt more warm and truly smelled like a mother’s when she would beat me up upon sensing the slightest hint of any mistake I had made, as I begged for my dad to intervene when he wasn’t even present, breathing every inch of air available around me, simply devouring it all like and snorting it in like a pig just to be swatted out of her sight like a fly, soon after which she would call me to her room, bursting into incessant series of wailings resembling a broken woman starved of love, and respect and a victim of her broken dreams. She would repeatedly chant about just how much she loved me, just how much she regretted it all and embrace in hugs which seemed as if she was clinging on to her life for one last time. Although, she does proceed with such treatments occasionally now and has finally sort of mastered her facade that is similar to an innocent child, deceiving enough, that now deafens the echoes of the screws falling off the hinges of her door. It is indeed dumb to even feel like this, but now it makes me feel as if I am becoming more like my mother while my mother becomes me, the child, clinging onto me whenever any inconvenience swell up, whenever she uncovers the unsightly facades of her poor pitiful naive husband everyday. She hits herself hoping she would be wiped off of the face of earth, a child filled with guilt and brutal anger, we really are just the reflections of each other. She clings onto me like a hopeless child really just ready to be put to bed to dive deep into never ending slumber. Her wailings no longer reminds me of an unstable mad woman but a child starved of love, waiting for her demise. It’s strange her warmth doesn’t feel like my mother’s anymore.

This explains what i feel the best i think but whats weirder is i used to pray for her to stop one day but now i cant help but wish she would hit more maybe to the point i bled out its like an itch in the back that i cant seem scratch but i wish she did and the hug me after, and continue the loop maybe then the itch would finally go away cuz im tired of scratching my skin off ",I dont know whats wrong am i just being overdramatic?,1743616539.0,1jpv413
MentalHealthSupport,"Three years ago, I was deep into anorexia, depression and anxiety. I couldn't get out of bed, revise for school, go to school, get a job etc. I tired medication and therapy with multiple different people, and it never worked. Im writing this to say that now I am the most uncaring free and happy person I could ever be. 

Everyone is different but I'm gonna say what got me out of it, as who knows it could help you or someone else reading this.

First of all I stopped feeling bad for myself and gave myself some tough luck, I was asking myself pretty deep questions. This is all because I went on google and watched shit load of videos on how little our time on earth matters in the grand scheme of the universe. If the Earth were to be 24 hours old, humans came into existence just 1 minute and 17 seconds ago. To make you feel even smaller a single human life on average is half a second if that. Now you might think that means life doesn't matter so why not just waste it... I think it means the opposite. Because if nothing inherently *matters* on a cosmic scale, then *everything* matters on a personal one.

You’re not bound by some predetermined purpose; you get to *choose* your meaning. If our time is fleeting, if we’re just tiny flickers in the vastness of space and time, then every moment we experience, every connection we make, every joy we seek is *ours alone*. Instead of being insignificant, our lives become *uniquely significant*—because *we* are the only ones who can define them.

Take your time, get yourself better and believe in yourself and your small time on earth, make the most of it even if that just means cleaning your room or doing something small you've been holding off on. It's all one step at a time and we're all fighting it together. 

We all believe in you and I truly hope all of your future dreams come true. But for now take it at your own pace!!!

I’ve made a mistake a month ago which was to let an old female friend, who she didn’t know, sleep over at my place and even bring her to my friends. I forgot to communicate it properly and that’s where our problems began. 

After that insecurities and problems understandably grew and she started getting more jealous of other women and had a big problem with me texting them. I deleted my Snapchat, the main social media app with which she had a problem in the hopes that it would help her trust me a bit more. 

Another important thing to know is that I suck at apologies, I got silent under pressure and if I do manage to say anything it’s because I carefully picked the words before so it doesn’t sound like complete shit. But if I do it that way my apologies don’t sound sincere, which I can understand but if I try to apologise correctly nothing comes and we just lay there in silence. 

Last week was where our relationship kind of collapsed completely, that was the last straw, she felt really bad and ugly and fat, which she only told me after I insisted I wanted to know in order to hopefully help her. But after she told me I went silent again and then I said something that had the complete opposite effect and she felt even worse.

MentalHealthSupport,"I (17) used to see a therapist for about a year and a half. I stopped going because of the cost, and we ran in circles in almost all of our sessions. The one piece of advice I took from that and other people in my life was that I needed to come to my parents about what I'm struggling with, but I've tried, and it doesn't seem to work. I have been dealing with anxiety, adhd, and autism symptoms my entire life, but I've never been diagnosed; that's just what others around me have told me. In recent years, I have taken to self-medicating with low doses of weed and alc, it's shameful and I don't like that I do it, but there is no other way to get my brain to slow tf down and just let me live in the moment/enjoy my hobbies. I've been feeling like a person is watching me whenever I've gotten high the past few times, but it's quite comforting. It's the same person every time, and I randomly get the feeling when I'm sober and zone out during the day. I sometimes feel like I'm a computer program being run by a group of scientists or that I'm a robot having the drivers switched out every so often. I'll get these feelings whether I'm sober or high; it used to be just when I took drugs, but now it'll be whenever.  I talk to my friends about it, and they just look at me like I'm the craziest person they've ever seen. They told me that I should talk to someone and try to get help because this isn't normal, and I agree. I told them today about a dream I had where a psychologist told me I was schizophrenic, and they pushed me to talk to at least my mom, so I did. But she just told me that I'm way too anxious, and she didn't listen to me when I tried to tell her that this isn't normal and there's something wrong.  She told me that she dealt with similar stuff and that she's not schizo so obviously I'm completely fine and nothing is wrong but I just cant shake the feeling that there's somehting else going on.

Its been 4 months since my mom’s cancer diagnosis, and my grandma’s too (my mother’s mom). It has been really tough. I have cried couple of times just because, but I actually feel numb. I feel confused, I dont really know how to react anymore. If I go in public, I act really confused. I have to clean, cook and take care (which my mother did) and take care of my younger siblings. I also always take care of mother’s and grandmas therapies, drive them to hospital etc. But lately, I found myself to be really nervous and kinda aggressive: for example, I just cleaned the bathroom, and my other family members go in and spill all the water or they simple do not care; I vacuum the floors and my family members goes to kitchen and eats while walking and spills everything; or the traffic; I feel like nobody appreciates this, and I end up cleaning non stop. It triggers me. I feel so trapped and stressed. Sometimes I just cant take it anymore and I feel so nervous.

I don’t know how to get past this or even begin to accept it.

To be held, to be spoken to with love yet you never see me……my spirits have been on the floor….my light….my glow slowly turned off but you never saw that….. I’ve been screaming for help from within and you never see it….wanting to be loved….. to feel like things will get better, that I will get better… wanting to feel appreciated for sacrificing me for another us yet I felt ugly, discarded, forgotten, unloved, like a burden, like a repeated problem, broken all over again. Begging for the help in simple things… while you gave me a cold shoulder and smug attitude most of the time. What had taken me a year to build in strength came crashing down day after day. But you’ve been fine because you found ways to replace me like always… you find ways to escape and to feel you while I’m useless to you like i always became after the fun is done and real life obstacles comes into play. 
I expressed myself and I did asked for help several time…. Maybe you don’t know what helping me is like.Yes I exploded every single time when my brain confirms what my heart and body have been telling me and I always tell you to leave and to never look back because of the pain you cause that in those moments become anger, because of the lack of respect, because of the lack of trust, because of cheating, because my conclusion ussion is always that you don’t love me 😶 that you’ve never loved me because love doesn’t always hurts you, because I love you and I will never hurt you how you hurt me.  Yes I exploded and maybe the little girl in me wants it all to not be true and for you to tell me that you love me and you would do anything for me for us for our future but you never do …. You always tell me it’s nothing when my heart is seeing and feeling different. What you do behind me it’s truly how you feel about me and time after time you’ve shown me. If there’s no honesty there’s no trust and if there’s not trust we can’t have a foundation and everything we built will always be destroyed. To be respected is to be loved, to be protected is to be loved, to change for the better is to be loved and to be seen is to be loved. For me to ignore the cheating and the same toxic cycle and what is happening and pretend things are fine and to keep it pushing is to loose me, its loosing myself respect and feeling like a joke which angers me to rage, its becoming bitter and resentful of you, its detaching. Everyday when you wake up i wish you would hug me and kiss me and at times want to make love to me but I know im pregnant and maybe not attractive for your or I look sick or have pushed you away with all of my sickness and when you come home i wish you would hug me and kiss me and want to be with me… tell me about your day, eat together and ask me about my day and give me advise or uplifting words if im down like i do to you. Maybe watch a movie together and cuddle idk anything but it never goes like that ……To be loved is to be respected even when no one is watching and I do not feel loved. To be loved is to be seen and I do not feel seen.  To be love is to burn the version of you that hurts me and to change for the better. Do you know how to love?

Im 22m.
I was bullied a lot as a child, and about 10 years ago I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder.
In my later teens and early adulthood, it did improve a lot.
But then my girlfriend of nearly 5 years cheated on me last year. I was in an awful place for a couple months, and didnt eat properly.
 But then I got better after a few months. I then got a job in Japan. It had been my dream for nearly 2 years at that point. I moved out here 8 months ago. The first 3 or 4 months were amazing. I loved every minute. And I even decided to recontract (they ask us quite early on).
Then winter hit and I think it was SAD at first. I dont usually suffer but I have the past couple of years. It hit really badly. I went up and down in wave. At one point my anxiety was so bad I couldnt be seen without a face mask on. Then I started developing an eating disorder. I  barely ate anything. Then I got to the point where I couldnt eat in front of other people. 

About a month ago that improved. But now Im right back there. I look in a mirror and think im fat, but then I can feel my ribs. Ive always been thin, but I think im getting too thin now. Its nearly 6pm and I only just ate my first meal of the day. Ive had suicidal thoughts. I feel like all my friends here hate me. Its so stupid. But its how I feel. I really want to go back home but as Ive already recontracted it would cause a lot of trouble.

She does *it a second time"" . I have trained myself to shove/hit/shout at men in these kinds of situation, but this was a female proffesor in full room and I *just froze and didn't raise my voice even* 

I moved away and she finally , without touching me, points out the student she wants me to see. 

I continue my discussion with her in a normal voice , but my panic had already started ATP.
I kept thinking ""*did she do it on purpose or am I over reacting ??"" "" Did she try to molest me "" ""Am I completely crazy for thinking a 60-70 yr old woman would try this ?""*

MentalHealthSupport,"I have been going through a lots of terrible things. The root cause of all  my problems is a very intense fear of being judged, stared and even a very extreme fear of listening to people talking. This fear of listening to people talking developed after I got startled during a class lecture( which I believe happened to me because I always used to be on edge due to the fear of being stared). Ever since then I have been so conscious about this behavior that whenever I sat next to a person talking I would get extremely anxious and I start feeling hot flushes all over my body. I also had another very serious problem that I cannot discuss for some reason but thankfully I have successfully overcome that without any professional help. I cannot look into anyone's eyes when I see someone looking at me or even if I just think that someone must be looking at me without ever daring to check whether anyone is looking at me makes me feel very sick. But this feeling very sick is an internal thing and cannot be seen by an outsider but besides this my eyes start blinking very fast just at the though of being stared by someone. The problem is that I cannot control these reflexes no matter how hard I try. This has been causing a lot of problem. When I tell people like my close friends that I don't do it on purpose they don't trust me, they think I am lying. So I have lost all my friends because this problem worsened very much this year and no one who is mentally healthy wants to be friends with a mentally sick person.

Firstly sorry for the long post. I’ve been having a lot of mental health issues since leaving home. Feel like it’s now or never for me in terms of turning my life around. As a Zimbabwean, mental health isnt a common topic, so I needed help to explain to my family, how is this? Any pointers or suggestions on how better I can help them understand?

Hey Everyone 

Firstly, I love you all. Despite my actions over the past few years that is maybe the one thing I am sure of. I love this family

I understand that because of how I’ve acted, I’ve broken your trust and abused your faith in me. I never wanted that to be true, but it is. I have neglected our family relationship and put an unnecessary strain on you all. It feels insincere to apologize, because it feels like it’s been too many times and too long. I just want you to know I am sorry and I do regret it.

I don’t want this to seem as me looking for pity or to play victim. I just want you to know what’s going on with me.

Over the last few years, I feel as though I have had less ambition, sense of purpose and general hope for myself. I struggle to push myself to do even the things I want to do. I’ve felt my hobbies like drawing, football and gaming all become less and less pleasing. It breaks my heart when people speak of the careers they want to follow, families they want have, dreams etc.. because when I think about that stuff I don’t have any hope or ambition for myself. I know I am capable but the mental battle is just too much for me. 

This has also affected me with friends and family. Like I said I love you all no doubt. Showing this and keeping communication has never been my strong suit. With friends I’ve found it difficult as well. Even when people reach out to help me I avoid it because I just feel like I’ll ruin things again. Especially as of late, I have been on this self destructive path  and I recognize it. Talking to women now for me isn’t even a thought because I can’t even look after myself and relationships I have already. Even when I have met a girl who I liked and I felt may have liked me, I always found a way to self sabotage. Even if I didn’t want to. 

Now this may be scary to talk about but here goes - I’ve had growing suicidal thoughts since early 2022. I have NEVER acted on them but I realized that they have grown in the years past. I am not happy with life, I feel like i just can’t fit into the normal school/work lifestyle. Yes I know few people are happy about that but most people get it done. I do not want to die, I also want a family of my own, to see you all again, make something of myself. But I just have this dreadful feeling that it’s not possible for me.
I know how serious this could become, I don’t feel like I’m a danger to myself but I don’t want to progress to that.

Lastly I don’t want any of you to feel as if you did something to make me feel this way. I am responsible for how I act and react to things. I am just feeling I’m at a point where things may go downhill and never recover if I don’t get my mind right.

I may not have structured the message the best but I needed to get as much across to you before I stopped myself or changed my mind

Thank you for reading 

Love *****

MentalHealthSupport,"\*\*\* possible triggers, be aware \*\*\*\*

I have a close person who constantly calls me and dumps all their trauma on me, for hours, with crying and screaming and complains. This goes years and years back. And while I know I should be supportive and nice and full of understanding, I feel overwhelmed and I can't do this anymore. I do care about that person a lot, but I can't, for the 200th time, listed to hour, two or three hours of same stories, same trauma, crying, problems and be expected to be supportive and prasing and full of understanding while I hardly ever get the same treatment if ever. If I try to say anything about my problems, I got shut down immediatelly, and I am told my problems are ""nothing, minor"" compaired to theirs, and then the focus is again on other person.

And yes, I tried, so so many times, to give as much constructive advices I could, I did researches, I gave my best, I tried, but that person always has ""excuse"" why that's ""impossible"" for them and why it can't be done (I think it really can f you want to). Sometimes, I am like ""this has to work!"" and they just shut me down, and keep on complainng without even tryung. This goes so fat that I feel traumatized whenever they call me and after the call I have to take sedatives for days to calm down, because I feel like it's getting worse. Sometimes, this person sounds quite irrational and when I point that and possible grattitudes they could have (ths person really COULD live great life only if they wanted, they could have everything!), all the blessings they have, they shut me down, start screaming how I don't understand, how I am not supportive, mentions self-harm, and then yells at me for being horrible to them.

Whatever I say is wrong. I feel like I can't deal with this, I can't win. They refuse to see a professional because they think the whole world is against them and their point is the only correct. It goes so far that everyone is their enemy and they are perpetual victim and martyr. I am starting to avoid that person because I can't deal with that. They refuse ANY help it appears that they just want to dump all the trauma on me. And I can't really anymore, whatever I say is wrong and I do not get the same support in return because apparently, my life is easy and perfect (spoiler: it is NOT).

I don't know what to do? I feel like giving up. I know I shouldn't and I am really scared of those self-harm threats but I lost all the ideas of how to react, what to say and how to help.

To start of, I am unable to have a professional consultation so I am undiagnosed as of current. All the things listed are just reoccurring issues that I've noticed and felt were off. Support, suggestions and discussions are most welcomed!! 

I've noticed an issue with my mental health a few years prior but it only got worse recently. The thing is, Im all sunshine and butterflies when I interact with people, whether it be at university, social gatherings or work. But when Im alone, I collapse completely. I lose hope of life, I feel uncontrollable rage and sadness and I just cant seem to imagine a future for myself. Its a pattern so I tend to keep myself occupied with hobbies or social interactions to avoid these crash-outs. Its just so bizarre to me how I have like 2 entirely different personas because everyone who knows me always say Im the happiest, most carefree person ever. But behind closed doors, I struggle to remain positive. Idk who to share this with either because whenever I feel negatively, I feel so alone and detached from everyone around me.

MentalHealthSupport,"32 (m) I have no clue what I’m doing anymore with life. I had a gf and stepkid of 5 years but we broke up. It was on me. But we weren’t happy anyways. So it was coming for awhile. Started talking to this new girl that said all the right stuff, was the perfect human for me. Well that didn’t work out, came to an absolute abrupt end. And end that caught me so off guard I don’t even know how to handle it. The breakup started in December, ended for sure January. 2 1/2 months talking to this girl and it has messed my brain up more than the 5 year relationship. And I didn’t even date her. Now if I take out the girl aspect, my bills just doubled because my ex moved out. So I’m struggling there, I turn to drinking because I cannot find a reason to smile or a shred of peace anymore. All the things I used to enjoy, I can’t find the excitement in them anymore. I don’t have friends. Like literally 0. The ones I thought I had, after I deactivated all my socials, (after an attention seeking episode, which I know isn’t the way, but I just wanted somebody to interact with at that point..) all I got was, hey man we need some of the stuff you have on Minecraft. Can you log in and give it back. No hey man how are you, not a fucking thing. I get I may be a man and the stigma it comes with, but I’ve done some hard shit in my life. And as of right now, it’s going home to a cat that my ex will take with her to her new apartment in may, with not a soul to talk to, not a human to talk about my shit to. Because if we’re being honest, I KNOW nobody actually gives a fuck. Because if they did, they’d have reached out by now. I’m forgotten, treated as a stepping stone. That’s all I’ll ever end up until my parents pass so I can finally do it. And this is the first time I’ve ever told anybody or said all this. And I feel what hurts is that I don’t know any of you, and I’m sure any replies may be genuine, but who are you to care for me? Why? Why take the time to read this sob story about a failed man?

Two years go by and last week she contacted me over the weekend to hangout. I met up with her and we had intercourse after I brought up that I was not looking for a relationship and not in the right place mentally which she seemed fine with. She started blowing up my dm’s and phone like crazy. I was being as nice as possible and I’m not the type to be a prick to anyone but was stern. It wouldn’t stop, like tens of messages every five minutes that made zero sense. I could hardly sleep dealing with this. After we hooked up she mentioned talking about me years ago to her friends and started a rumor that I was basically a man whore which is definitely not the case. I blocked her and woke up to a phone call from her family… they explained to me on the phone that she was not mentally well and was having a psychotic episode because of me. I explained to them everything that happened which was hard to do already. I had to talk to her whole family on the phone multiple times and even offered to take initiative to get her help again.

I’m not really sure how to start this. I have never truly spoken about my mental health in this much detail before, but I need some help.

So, I have always felt the way I do. I can’t really explain how I feel, because to be honest, I don’t know. I have always struggled to put myself first, I’ve always felt lost. I hate myself to the point where I tell people lies about myself because the real me isn’t good enough. In fact, there isn’t a “real me”, just a persona created from a web of lies. I never tell anyone the full story.

I know deep down, I will never be good enough, I am inferior to everyone. This has been a reality for me my whole life. In school I went through tests for autism, before this, I thought it was normal to feel the way I do. Anyway, these tests resulted in me being diagnosed with autism at 17, which did not help me feel better, it just made me realise the way I think about the world and myself isn’t normal.

Since then I have tried to help myself feel useful and like something that’s worth being around. It hasn’t worked. When I was 18 I contemplated killing myself, so I took a razor and cut the outside of my forearm deep just to see how much it would hurt for when I did it for real. The pain wasn’t that bad, but it was the questions asked by people around me that hurt the most. I realised how many people would be affected by me killing myself. And I realised it would be too much of an inconvenience to others for me to kill myself and thankfully my lies were good enough to stop people worrying about me. I haven’t tried again since.

Last year I joined the police, I thought it would help me feel important. I thought helping others would help me help myself. It has not helped, I have seen some horrible stuff, some of those things keep me up at night, and now I am being assessed for PTSD. Every day I try to do something good, so I can get some sort of contentment from this job. I haven’t achieved this.  I fact it’s made me feel worse. I mean, how dare I feel like this when every day I meet someone doing worse than me? I should be able to just get on with life.

I don’t know what to do anymore, it’s gotten to the point where I don’t look after myself. I only wash and wear clean clothes for the benefit of others and I don’t really leave my house when I’m not working. I need something to make me feel something other than felling angry with myself. I don’t think I know what happiness feels like, is it nice?

I feel terrible even writing this, I don’t feel like I have the right to feel the way I do. I feel like I’m showboating by sharing this and I know there may be people reading this that have their own afflictions  and I don’t want to come across like I am trying to compete for sympathy. I hope this isn’t too long, but I can’t shorten this anymore than I already have.

all my life ive had extreme struggle with my self esteem. nothing i ever did seemed good enough to me, even tho i always desperately wanted praise it always felt like a lie when i got it. and objectively i achieved a lot while i was still in the guided structure of school and am a reasonably smart and capable person. i cant genuinely believe i am, i just know that it probably is true.

i have always been extremely anxious of the opinions of others and been extremely anxious in general. especially as a child i had extremely strong feelings of anger and shame. the anger issues were so bad that i ended up trying to avoid other people bc i felt i would always get triggered by something and had no control over my response and i didnt want to hurt others. i would attack others, sometimes with ""reasonable"" provocation but other times with virtually none.

my emotions are much more in control as an adult but now i get intrusive thoughts about really not very major embarrassments that make me want to scream or curl up and die. you know just moments where i said something awkward or my fly was down kind of innocous embarrasments. they feel like some sort of psychic attack, but if i try to choose to remember these moments it doesnt bother me, only when they randomly break into my brain.

crucially, ive had extremely violent and disturbing sexual thoughts since i was about 9 or 10 years old. and i just dont understand why. i still find... that type of pornography arousing if i just see it but repulsive if i actively think or fantasise about it. which means 10 year old me was even more depraved than adult me.

TLDR; i hate myself with every fibre of my being and had sexually violent thoughts by the age of 9 or 10

so ive always been thinking about my life and why i would be this way as an impressionable kid. i thought i was never abused. my dad had anger issues, but not that bad. my only real ""traumatic"" memory is being suffocated by my mother on accident when she was trying to stop me from crying and i was panicking and couldnt breathe. 

but recently ive been having this recurring thought of the school showers when i was 5 or 6 years old. i have this feeling that something happened, that i was groped by a teacher after everyone else had left or something. but then im wondering why havent i ever remembered this before? and i feel like maybe im just making this up to feel better about being such a disturbed creep? i dont remember much just vague impressions",is it possible to make up fake trauma?,1743468464.0,1joj38g

Hi, all. Let me get right into it.

Recently my son & I moved out of a family members house. For a couple of reasons. 
1. Abuse- every form of. (Abuse was towards me, not my son)
2. Their house was **so** horribly filthy it made me sick. (My son somehow did not get sick but being there was triggering enough)

The house was a mobile home and had been flooded a couple of times so the floor was rotted out. There were holes in the floor, some big enough for animals to crawl in & out of. Holes in the ceiling. Insulation exposed. The property had over 40 cats- most stayed out but about 7 or so came in. They pissed on EVERYTHING. Crawled into the cabinets (you guessed it, holes) and all over the dishes. Walked all over the counter and stepped all over the “clean” dishes laying out to dry. 
Black mold under the sink. Water came from a well with a terrible scent that didn’t smell like a well typically would (there was no hot water either). Sometimes there were mice. Sometimes roaches. Sometimes snakes. The outside/yard pretty much smelled of cat urine everywhere you went. Y’all get the picture.

My son & I both have autoimmune issues/chronic illnesses and I am also dealing with cancer. I was sick sick SICK at that house. So. I packed up our little car. Kissed our dog (ESA) goodbye for now, and we left. We slept in our car for a few nights and then went to a shelter. That shelter told us to go to the Salvation Army- and so we did.

It’s been an extremely helpful time being here, but we received some unfortunate news today. We have an exit date of April 7th. The Salvation Army only provides a 30 day program so we’ve received more help than most. (We’ve been here two months)

While I’m grateful to have had any help at all, I’m stressing like crazy. We are both on disability- on the same case, and have limitations. I can only earn a certain amount per month on top of the monthly benefits (which are under $900 for both of us combined- and 98% of it goes to our car payment, car insurance, and storage) or they’ll cancel the benefits and take away my health insurance. I NEED my health insurance. Additionally, my son is on Medicaid so I have to watch how much I make for his sake too. He’s got a pretty major heart condition that has already required multiple open heart surgeries, will require at minimum one transplant, and he’s going to be starting immunotherapy soon for a completely different condition.

I do not have family to help. I do not have friends to help. Idk what to do except cry & pray. I would do much better in life with help (like a roommate) but I don’t feel comfortable living with a stranger. I have been sexually abused, and raped more times than I can count. And of course abused in general. I have also been kidnapped. I have a very, very, very hard time trusting people. To make things extra fun, we happen to be autistic- which seems to annoy the piss out of a lot of people. 

My job for the last two years has been DoorDashing when I feel up to it. It’s perfect for me because I can’t get into trouble for canceling a shift at last minute when I’m weak or sick. And of course I get to make my own schedule so that’s a huge bonus. Anyways. We’re on the waitlist for housing but… it’s a wait of up to 9 years. At this point I’m praying for a miracle. Most places for rent around me require 3x the rent for monthly income. Which, is a stretch.

MentalHealthSupport,"My feeling of depression and social anxiety were always episodic but since a couple of days ago I’ve just snapped. These feelings won’t go away, I’m paranoid for my social life and feel that whoever I meet just silently hates me and only acts the other way when I’m nearby. I’ve gotten to a point where i likely hate myself more than anyone else does me. Every afternoon when I’m alone my mind goes over every time I’ve hurt someone or how ugly I think I am, and how I’m destined to be alone until I die. I view myself as one of those goblin discord mods/reddit freaks( I mean the annoying kind that wear porkpie hats and think they’re always right). This wasn’t helped when I showed some people I thought were my friends a post on Reddit, and they said yeah “you look like you use Reddit”. I know I’m just a burden to anyone who I hang out with, and whenever I’m in class I feel like I’m just the class retard (I have Asperger’s) that the teachers have to compliment or get fired. And whenever I show emotion I feel like someone’s going to use it against me and say I’m faking it or it’s because I didn’t get what I wanted. An example of which is when I didn’t get anything from the judges for my jazz solo at a contest (if you were good they’d give you a ribbon saying so) I just felt like I wasn’t good enough like I’m horrible at what I’m passionate about and amazing at fucking things up by being a blundering oaf with about as much life purpose as a paper weight.

I have a history with weed and being constantly high for weeks on end, as well as things like mushrooms and harder powders. I’ve felt this way for a while, but within the last month my brain has ramped up and I can’t stop flooding my mind with inner monologue. For example, in all my classes I cannot learn, nor retain any info I do grasp. My mind is always racing and constantly thinking about whatever the fuck. It’s something I feel I can’t describe right, but it feels like it’s slowly eating away at me. I’ve never been tested or diagnosed with anything, so as far as that I say I don’t have any mental health disorders. I believe I am smart, I consider myself to be smarter than a lot of my peers, and that is why I feel too sentient, because everyone around me seems like they don’t work they way I do.

MentalHealthSupport,"I (F20’s) have been struggling badly as of late. For maybe 2-3ish years I haven’t been able to let go of things I’ve done. I really don’t want to get into it but I overthink EVERYTHING. I’m afraid of looking people in the eye, I’m scared of having fun, I don’t feel I deserve to be happy, im afraid of being in public, I can go on. 

At my absolute worst I posted (a year ago?) and people told me I may have OCD, or experiencing symptoms of it. 

When I looked into that community I felt both relieved and afraid. On one hand I found out I wasn’t alone, but on the other hand I still felt like a monster… 

Lately I’ve noticed that most people who have OCD, anxiety, and many other illnesses have had them since childhood, or have known since childhood. 

My mental health got slammed in my early 20’s and again it was because of something stupid I did. I don’t really think I ever did anything as a kid that would’ve been a “sign”. It all has me feeling like I’m just trying to justify my guilt, shame, and state of being. 

Been looking into getting professional help but now I don’t feel I deserve it… Like I did this to myself and there are people out there who have been struggling their whole life and don’t know why. I just don’t know why it suddenly took a turn. 3 years ago I was having the time of my life despite the things I did, and now I cry almost every night and sometimes at work. 

I feel like I’m just realizing I’m a bad person and trying to make myself feel better by saying “I have something” I literally don’t know what happening to me… I want to be left completely alone but I also want to be held and have someone tell me that I’m gonna be okay, but also if you touch me I’ll get mad.

Just wanna get this off my chest.
I lost my dad last year and since then things have been different to me, i didn't had access to that ""Teenage Phase"" where you hang out with ur friends, and do stuff you remember nd laugh on... 

On top of that i have no support at home, my mother doesn't understand the concept of ""Emotionally Absent"".
She just wants me to do every task like a machine and study for lik 7 hrs a day.

I do some filming nd sketching to distract myself but when the night falls, im again there questioning myself.

I have some 2-3 online peeps whom i talk to but they ghost me most of the time, thru out the day they don't even bother to drop a single text. If i text first the convo will go on or else it won't.

I understand everyone have a life beyond internet too but what about those who don't? 

It's not like i want them to talk to me 24/7 but is it so much to expect someone talk to you for 15 min straight? No ghosting, no late replies.

And i get it, most of the users here are here for their own fun, their own interests, not to be available to listen someone yapp.

What do i do then?
It feels like I'm locked in a quiet white room. 
Go to therapy? Well..i can't afford it, also at the end they too will suggest me to socialize. 

But what's the point when no one wants to socialize with me? 

Just how many times will i knock the door over and over again?

MentalHealthSupport,"I typed up this email to my therapist who I’m im about to start switching to a different one, partly out of desperation for catharsis, but also legitimately for help because idk who else to contact, but I’m worried she could call the police to have me committed and forced to take drugs I don’t want to, for context I have ADHD and CPTSD, and I’m also pretty sure I have OCD. I’m really worried I might try to take my own life, any info/help/advice/support would be greatly appreciated. I really don’t want to be committed but I can’t go downstairs. TY in advance Hi ____, sorry to bother you like this, I suppose you probably won’t see this in the middle of the night so that’s good I hope. Any some weird and inexplicable happened again and I am not handling it well. I don’t feel as though I can talk to _____ right now about this because I don’t want to stress him out any further than he already is. I don’t feel like talking to my mom right now is a good idea, she deliberately coerced me into an uncomfortable situation while I said “ you (I meant to say “I” there but accidentally wrote you and now I’m worried it means something so I’m leaving it in 🤷)don’t want to do this, this is making me really uncomfortable, I think I just want to leave.” That’s I think an exact quote (obviously aside from that parenthetical part and the mistake it refers to), because she enjoyed watching me in discomfort. And my dad is noticeably anxious when talking to me now. I think it’s because he started therapy which I think ultimately will have a positive effect on our relationship but for this particular point, he uncovered the wound but has yet to address it so that’s not good for me personally at this specific time. I can’t go down my stairs, something inexplicable happened again, that’s why never want to come up here, because weird, seemingly supernatural, of at least inexplicable in being ostensibly physical impossible. It scares me up here now, I don’t want to be up here, I acquiesced to pet wanting me to follow him up here which lately I’ve been extremely reluctant to do. I was dreading having to do my ritual I need to do when I go downstairs to prevent bad things from happening that sound dumb so I’m embarrassed to talk about it. It’s bad, the irony is what I dread and do the ritual to prevent seems way more likely  ow that that thing happens, I guess I haven’t said what that thing was yet but it was the chandelier slamming into the wall after I had I had already tapped it to get it to tap the wall twice before losing energy and coming to a rest, if it had made audible contact with the wall a third time I would have had to do it over again before touching the ground floor to prevent me from ruining the future of my life (it’s just so ironic, Ive been stuck in such a catch 22 having to indulge a vice that makes me crazy in order to get support to prevent me from going crazy that hinges on me not giving the help the impression that I’m crazy, it doesn’t seem fair, but I guess nobody said it would be and I’m sure there are people that would think me saying that is unfair. I feel like I’m going to be sick. Back to the chandelier (that sounds super fancy, it’s a hanging light but I think that’s what you call that 🤷), so I touch it in just the right way with my middle and index fingers, without my ring finger touching any surface, with one foot on the third step up from the middle and the other on the wall sort of opposite it. I said my little thing for that first position that let go of the hanging light. It made contact with the wall twice as I went to the second position where with my left hand,this is going to sound weird because it’s hard to explain and I’m tired but the ceiling sort of has two large steps built into it above the actual steps, so the first ceiling step I had my index and middle finger on the wall, thumb and pinky on the ceiling, and without anything touching my ring finger. I said my ritualistic sentence then did the same thing for the second calling step, ritual complete so I continued downward to be on the ground level and after I had taken my first foot off the last step to step onto the floor with my first foot to touch it, and my body weight position ed where I was going to make contact with the ground floor, I was midstep past the point of no return when the hanging light loudly slammed into the wall so the ritual was fucked up because it hit the wall too many times, 3 times and not two but I went all the way down instead of restarting, doing it over and doing it right to prevent losing my chance for happiness and ruining my life, but I didn’t and I made it all the way down the stairs in spite of that so now it feels like I’ve doomed myself to at least a lifetime of perpetual, bitter despair. I feel like I’m in hell. So it just somehow acquired the energy to be able to do loudly slam into the wall just at the right moment to ruin my life in the tiny moment where there was nothing I could do to stop it at that point. I immediately screamed and ran back upstairs, I looked at pet and he just stared at me I was incredibly panicked and I forget exactly what happened then but very soon after that I was crying, I cried for little bit trying to think of a way out of it before realizing that there was no way out and accepting my hopelessness, then I started to panic again as I tried to scramble for ways to convince myself to not just cut to the chase and save myself from the suffering, I’m not sure how long that took, pet  just stared at me, I know it’s not his fault obviously but I can’t get over the fact that if I had just not gone upstairs this wouldn’t be happening. I think I’ve tried to go downstairs twice but haven’t been able to get the ritual right, and worse I think I have to get it right twice in a row, to get it first to neutral and then to positive I’m thirsty and my medication is downstairs. I have no one who can come help me. I want to talk to someone but there isn’t anybody who can come help me. I’m at a loss, idk what to do, I’m scared, please don’t call the cops on me, please don’t do that I have PTSD related to police, I can’t handle any more stress, I don’t want to be forced to take drugs anymore, I never wanted them in the first place, they were forced on me like that elective cosmetic dental surgery. I don’t understand, it’s just like _____ said, I’m too traumatized for people to understand me. Not to mention no one would ever believe one person would have this much bad luck, of course people are going to side with the therapist if I tell anyone about it. This seems cruel, why am I so nice and why do so many bad things happen to me, I don’t understand it.

I'll try to keep it short. My partner has self-harming tendencies and is subject to substance and drug abuse. They regularly self harm and they don't want to get professional help. Their point of view is that they are dying, so why bother? They have physical disabilities and often have organ failures and pass out. Basically, their body has slowly been dying over the past decade and they feel they are on their last legs. They've tried getting professional help before but it hasn't worked. They are constantly in pain, so self harm is ""their way of have control"" over when they feel pain. Drugs also help them dull out the pain and keep the experience more tolerable.

MentalHealthSupport,"i started seeing a new psychiatrist and got my final (we hope) diagnosis back at the start of the pandemic and have been medicated for it since then. i won’t specify which one but for clarity the diagnosis is a mood disorder and not GAD, although anxiety is the primary factor. obviously i want the psychiatric help or i wouldn’t be making the appointments and paying for the prescriptions, but since almost the beginning i’ve been fudging the numbers when she asks me to rate my anxiety and depression. i hate the back and forth of medication, i was on the wrong meds due to a misdiagnosis for years and it was fucking awful. i don’t like the risk that my answers will change my prescription even if know logically it might NEED to change. i’m also terrified of being admitted to a mental hospital for too many reasons to list here and i’ve been afraid that if i answer a certain way my therapist or psych would be legally mandated to report it and i’d be “locked up”. 

the thing is, i acclimate to medication stupidly fast and i’ve been on the same dose (the highest dosage any psych will prescribe for this specific medication) for at least a year so i’d be willling to bet anything that my meds aren’t even working anymore. however i’ve been in talk therapy for the past year or so (with this therapist in particular, i stopped seeing the last therapist in 2018 due to finances) and my therapist and i have both come to the conclusion that i have enough coping skills that i don’t need to be medicated for anything but my anxiety. everything else i have more or less under control from decades of practice, i just need extra help with the anxiety because that’s the only part i still really struggle with. when i’m depressed or angry i have any number of self soothing methods and i can handle anxiety to a certain point as well but i have a significantly worse physical and psychological response a lot quicker than any other symptom. i struggle to breathe, i can’t focus, i have a movement disorder that gets worse with stress so i’m shaking like a leaf and can’t walk or keep a grip on anything with my hands. it also makes me unable to drive, in the past it’s happened mid drive and i’ve had to hold my foot down on the pedals with my hand to get home which is not safe or something i ever want to have to do again even if i did make it home in one emergency situation.

so now my question is: how do i admit that i’ve been dishonest in our previous evaluations when i’ve been keeping this a secret for years? i know i did this to myself and i should’ve just told her the truth from the start but my time on the wrong meds really fucked with my head and she’s the first psych i’m seeing as an adult where it’s fully on me to advocate for myself when in the past i usually just sat and nodded while my dad told my old psych what he thinks is going on in my head and only checking in to make sure i’m validating everything he’s saying. i’m just tired of feeling like i’m doing all the leg work with my depression and emotional regulation while the anxiety goes from manageable to crippling but now i’ve dug myself too deep in the hole and i want to get out.

With Trump and his goons in office, I've been so overwhelmed with my anxiety that it's becoming too much to handle. Life just feels like a nightmare per day, waking up with the craziness we are all living in. I've been trying to do other things to keep my mind busy with no luck.

I used to see a therapists at the beginning but I stopped because I'm hyperaware about my issues so after a point it felt useless. I have various insecurities like no guy I loved has ever loved me back, I've never had sex, i have various interests but I've never pursued something passionately. I have always been insecure about my body but it's worse since 2022 because I gained a lot of weight because I used to eat my feelings away. I got a full time job a few months back in a career I liked so things were a bit better since I was too busy. Now I'm still busy but i can feel the depression creeping back in. I cancel plans, I keep eating until i stop hearing the voices in my head, i don't call my friends or family, i don't step out of the house on my day offs and I spend a lot of time sleeping or laying idle on my bed. I feel so numb, sometimes I feel like someone should walk up to me and slap me hard or maybe hit my head into a wall so I can finally feel something. I feel like I'm stuck and everyone around me is just passing by me. People my age are all better than me, people older to me find me worthless, guys only want to talk to me on text or at my house because they are ashamed to be seen with me. I am afraid to age because right now i literally cannot imagine what my future would look like 5 years from now. I don't dream like I used when I was kid.

She says well then just give up. She says well this is just how I am. And I say but why don’t you even care enough about me to even try? You can’t claim that you care about me or how I feel and then spend months actively being the reason I feel this way and purposefully refusing to put in any sort of effort and be able to look me in the eyes while I cry and beg and still feel absolutely no want to make an effort. 

And my dad taking her side when he has literally seen it all and see her do these things is making me feel like I’m the insane one and I’m the one who’s in the wrong when I know that I’m not. 

How can you claim/pretend that you’d care about me if I were crying everyday at a new college, when not once have you cared about me crying and how I feel? If you didn’t care about the things I’m upset about now, then what the fuck do you care about huh? The things I’m sad/miserable/upset about now, ARE the exact fucking things that I’ll probably struggle with in college. And you’re not going to care then either. 

Like if you don’t care now and haven’t ever cared throughout this entire time, what makes you think there would be any difference in a couple of months? She’s literally said it herself that her definition of caring only includes physical things (food and taking care of someone when they’re sick) and when I said caring about how I feel is another big part of “caring” she refused it and we argued about it and in the end she pretty much concluded that that didn’t matter and caring about someone did not include that. Even after defining that over and over again, she somehow still had the audacity to claim she would care if I cried.

And the fact that she knows how it affects me, the fact that she can do these things and say these things without a second thought, without even feeling bad, and then just continue going about her life like nothing happened while it impacts me, just goes to show how little she cares","How can my mom have the audacity to claim that she cares about me and would care about me if I cried at my first year in college when I have stood sobbing before her time and time again, begging her to try and she refuses over and over again and tells me she doesn’t want to hear it?",1743360703.0,1jnjj7z
MentalHealthSupport,"I'm 27 years old, about to finish a communications minor at the most prestigious university in my country (yeah, took me some time; a lot happened) and I think I have ok plans about how to make the most of it. The thing is, guys: I don't want to do it anymore. I've come far, but I had to force myself every step of the way; I seriously don't remember how true accomplishment feels like. I carried my ass along the way thanks to the ""strenght"" my utmost fear gave me: to not be a failure.

To me, this meant: to be able to give my mother the life she deserves, to be able to help the rest of my family and to enjoy myself. What stopped me? Me, myself and I. Even though I'm fairly good at my career of choice (analysing texts, writing and stuff), I suck at the most important aspect of it: communicating. I chose to study comms as a way to force myself out of my comfort zone and deal with my social anxiety and, now I realize, I fucked up.

To go through college, I had to participate in all sort of social-based projects and, evidently, I had to interact with my own classmates. Turns out I couldn't, at least not naturally and comfortably. The only way I could silence that was by using alcohol and drugs. Fuck, it felt good while it lasted; but I knew I couldn't keep that forever without risking serious damage to my body.

I've been sober 2 years now, and that came with the challenge of having to face hard truths: I wasted my twenties living in a depressive state, which means I didn't enjoy myself traveling/meeting people/falling in love (I really really really wanted to do all of that); I need to get my act together soon, but I just want to feel free to do the things I haven't been doing (previously mentioned); now that i know myself a little bit better, there's another career I'd like to practice but I'm haunted by the thought I just don't have time anymore.

In summary, I need ideas. I know my problems are not exceptional, so I know there's a side to this that's not all pessimist; but I just can't see it right now. I'm having thoughts like ""I hope everyone just forgot about me"" so that I could just leave and never be found, but I know I'm in the wrong there. If you've ever felt lost, like you've fucked up to the very bottom; but somehow you managed to get out: was it worth the struggle? would you finish a career if you didn't really want it? how do you manage the regret of what you did and the time you lost?

This was all so visceral I hardly understand myself, but I felt like I needed to tell or, at least, put it in writing. Maybe I should get a diary or something. If you read it until this point, thanks.",what would you do?,1743361425.0,1jnjtal

MentalHealthSupport,"F24. I’ve always had some issues with anger. I tend to hide that part of myself, and never lash out at others. When I’m angry and around people, I either cry or dissociate. More often the latter. But why I’m I so angry all the time?

Some backstory; I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder in 2020, and that diagnosis was correct back then and the following few years. 
I’ve also struggled with depression and anxiety since i was 12 ish. But now I feel like there’s something wrong. I do not associate with the bpd symptoms anymore and haven’t for the past year after I got out of a turbulent relationship.

But the depression is still kicking my ass. I’m on meds, but it’s only doing so much. I do have smaller periods of feeling good where I finally have the confidence, energy and motivation for live that I so dearly wish I had all the time. It does have it cons, since I also act more impulsively during this time, especially when it comes to money spending and drinking. But the depression always comes back. Now I’ve also started struggling with feeling angry all of the time. I’m irritated and frustrated, and my fuse is soo short. I hate feeling this way, as I have a conflicted relationship with that particular emotion.

I don’t know what’s wrong. It’s been getting gradually worse the past 3 months. Right now I also feel hopeless. I don’t know what do to with my future. I’m almost done with my bachelors degree related to social work but I’m no way motivated for that sort of work. I don’t have the capacity..
I’m trying to do everything right. I take my meds, I’m physically active almost every day, I drink maybe once per month, I don’t do any drugs and I get 7-9 hours of sleep per night- most nights. Even though I feel like I could sleep for 14..

This is a chaotic post, I’m sorry. But I hope it makes some sort of sense. I’m just confused and tired of feeling broken.

My panic attacks have gotten worse, I am so much more stressed and just tired. Last January when I was having test week (9th grade core) I had a panic attack during a test but I have been for a very long time (since I was 9/10), and the idea of someone seeing me have a panic attack gives me a panic attack, so I sort of just having one in my head. Long story short, I went to a teacher (she is the coach of our class but not she is not my coach but she is like a half coach so i still went to her cause my coach was sick) and I tell her ""yeah so during your test i had one of these panic attacks in my head"" and she looks at me and is like ""yeahhh that sucks. Anyways i know you struggle with my subject so-"" EXCUSE ME. A student just told you they have panic attacks and you say that 😭 So eventually I did go to my own coach, luckily she was more serious and she got me to talk with the school music teacher and my old coach (she is a teacher that kids go to when they have mental problem). I have been talking with her since January and what have we established? That I am really on the edge! And that I clearly need help to a point that my coach and her are concerned. She told me ""you are goiny to talk to your mom this friday."" Uhmmm... it's Sunday and I didn't talk yet 😋 oopsie. No but I actually feel bad for it, because she is trying so hard to help me and I just don't do anything she says. Partly because I forgot, but also cause I'm scared. I don't want my parents to worry and they already have alot going on with my sister. I tried to talk to my mom again by saying ""let's go for a walk!"" But she said no but my dad could go. Now I don't have any problems with my dad, but my dad is better with school problems and my mom with mental health. Now tomorrow I have test week again and I am just so stressed for it. It so the 3rd and second last test week of the year and if this goes wrong I'm pretty much done for. And then I have friends saying ""oh but just come to mavo!""

I know it sounds really stupid like, bro you're only 19 what are you nostalgic about. I just miss how things used to be and the people that were part of life at the time, and I feel like I'll never as 'happy' as was I back then. The thing is that I don't think I was even that happy back then, i was actually quite depressed most of the time. But the friendships that I had with those people was in some way special, mostly because I never had that many friends, and those people that I used to hang out with or talk to are not in my life anymore. I still talk to some of them but i just doesn't feel the same, Now everything feels so pointless, and I don't really have a strong purpose in my life

I've dealt with depression and anxiety since my early teens, and tried to comite suicide once. At 16, I was addicted to xanax, used to smoke a lot of cigarettes and at 17–18 i was drinking a lot , but looking back at it, I feel like I was happier back then. For the past year I've on a self help journey and I quit the bad habits that I used to have and tried to find my purpose in life, but even though my life is technically better right now, i just feel like i'll never be as happy as i was.

Worked really hard for the last 2 years to achieve this but I'm just realizing it's not what I want. I don't know what I want. I started taking pills and smoking weed at 13. I would drink when I couldn't get the preferred choices.I was never supposed to make it this far. I had not prepared for this. I tried to overdose when I was 15 which was unsuccessful, obviously.

Yet, it's still not enough. I feel lost. I have suicidal thoughts frequently, mainly since my promotion. I work 47+ hours a week and it kills me. Money is not what drives me.

MentalHealthSupport,"I don't know how to keep going

I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this, I don't want to keep doing this. I don't want to live, I'm tired. 

I can't count the number of times I've woken up and my first thoughts are of ending things. I want peace, I want freedom, I want to stop feeling shitty all the time, I want to experience life as a better, more valuable man. I struggle to believe that's possible for me, I feel too far gone, too wrong, like life wasn't meant for me. 

I don't know why I never went to college, maybe I was too lazy, or too far gone with mental health. I was still able to get an okay job, with benefits and an average wage. Despite that, my upward mobility is likely non-existent, I'm going to be this forever, I'm never going to be impressive the way I would need to be to live the life I envision. I work with taxes, and regular see people paying more with a single cheque than I've ever accumulated over the course of my entire life, it's crushing. I failed financially. 

Not that my job is going to do me much good if the world implodes. Things just seem to get worse, life is unaffordable, populations are getting dumber and more violent and more hateful, social cohesion is dissolving, new wars are starting, the environment is screwed, scientists have noticed an asteroid. I failed to be lucky, to be born in a better time and place. 

I struggle socially. I have a few good friends, and I see them semi-regularly, but I'll lose them eventually and I doubt my ability to make new ones; I certainly don't have the energy or mental bandwidth. I've never been in a relationship, and as uncomfortable as it is to admit, sex is a big problem. I spent my childhood religious, learning to be deeply uncomfortable with the idea of intimacy done ""incorrectly"", and now that I've deconstructed I realize that it was never going to work for me anyway. I'm not attractive, not tall, not fit, not funny, not charismatic, not rich, not anything -

- what I am is a hypocrite, being attracted to and desperately wanting experiences with women who I find exceptionally attractive while I look the way I do, without the ability to offer any kind of attractiveness in return. Please don't misunderstand, I'm not a misogynist, I don't think I'm entitled to it. I dislike and vehemently disagree with incels; they spread and perpetuate wrong and harmful rhetoric. Unfortunately the term applies to me, definitionally. If I end up leaving life behind, I hope people don't remember me as being lumped in with them. I failed to be the person I wanted to be.

i have a close group of friends and family that love me. i’ve got no real financial strifes, no toxic relationships or traumatic experiences to speak of. i just despise myself so much. 

i’ve always been too in my head, i’ve thought about suicide pretty much since i first learned what it was. once again nothing bad has ever even happened to me, sometimes i think i made myself this way by being too self pitying and overly egotistical.

i’m a deeply anxious person, everything makes me anxious, i feel on the verge of a panic attack when faced with the most minuscule mishaps. i’ve always been this way, it’s exhausting. 

i dislike my personality. i’m lazy, self pitying and passive aggressive. 

my voice is too loud, i get bored easily and i don’t pay attention to things. im not a great listener or speaker. all my stories are boring and take too long. i get too drunk and high. i can be mean and inconsistent and irresponsible. im weird and awkward and sometimes when im in a group of people, i’ll say something and it feels like they can tell there’s something off with me. 

school was the only thing i was ever ‘good’ at, but im not even good at that anymore. im too lazy and i procrastinate too much and it feels like i blinked and everyone became smarter than me, and they’re all leaving me behind and everyone will realize how i was always nothing to being with.

i’ve never really been someone’s favorite person (maybe my parent’s but our relationship is complicated) and i just can’t help but twist that idea in my head like a wrung out towel. 
i understand why no one wants me, as i’ve said, i wouldn’t want myself either. but this makes me miserable. i know a relationship would fix nothing, but at least then id know that someone sees something in me that isn’t shit. 

i know some of you will say i should talk to therapist but i can’t do that. telling my family is too much. they don’t know im so unhappy and i can’t let them know. it would be too unfair and too much to explain and i don’t know what id say, “sorry guys! life is too much for me, i know everyone else can do it but i can’t! i’m too much of a crybaby!” 

i really don’t have think i have a mental illness. i’m not miserable all the time. i have fun and i love life at many points, it’s just that when things are bad it truly feels to me like the world is ending. i break down like a toddler throwing a tantrum over the tiniest thing. 

i’ve been good at not letting anyone else see these episodes but they’re slipping through the cracks more and more and i’m having one every other day. i’m tired of always feeling like everything is wrong. i hate that im not happy, i don’t know why i can’t stop being the way i am.

Before you decide to pull a 'my sister' I CANNOT leave this for later, I CANNOT ""focus on my mental health right now"", I don't have money for it. I'll have time and money to deal with that when I have my degree.

checking multiple mirrors in all different lightings and angles to make sure your hair and makeup look good enough, even in the car mirror on your way to work

asking your family member if your makeup looks fine, or if it’s overdone or not done enough but you always get the same answer and sign of annoyance so you’re convinced they’re lying to you

go to the bathroom before you clock in to see if it’s still okay and if it’s not, you really do feel even more ugly that day the rest of your day is affected in a bad mood and insecurity

you avoid eye contact so they don’t see your face

you’re convinced everyone is staring at you, looking at you, judging you. And if they’re laughing, they’re laughing at you.

you constantly look for something to see your reflection in

you go to the bathroom every hour so you can see yourself to see if you’re okay

then you leave and go home and once you’re ready for bed 

go get ready to sleep but don’t take your makeup off because you can’t stand to see yourself without it

I (21M) am in a long-distance relationship with a girlfriend who shows concerning behaviors:

* She self-harms (cutting, starving herself) when I don't respond due to exams or work
* She's sacrificing her education to talk to me (grades plummeting, skipping classes)
* She's extremely attached and has built elaborate future plans while I don't see a future
* I care about her but don't feel romantic love - I'm staying mainly because I fear what she'll do if I leave

I broke up with her once before due to similar issues and she tried to end herself already, and her mental state is bad, though she denies it and rejects and has rejected my offer to pay for her therapy. I know I need to end this, but I'm genuinely concerned she may attempt suicide if I do. Even if I alert her friends, I worry it won't be enough.

I’ve tried talking to her about my problems, not as much or as strongly as I should have, but this isn’t the place for relationship advice. 

How can I end things with her without her committing something bad or harming herself in any way? 


Apologies if I broke any rules or anything, I’m just worried and tired.

Dad was military, grew up with strict childhood (my sister would say violent *for me*, not her) but in my mind normal. Don’t let that become topic of conversation either please. Since I was a teenager I have struggled with a short temper, quick to fight anyone, aggressive at all costs. As I’ve grown older I’ve learned the whole time and place aspect and picking your battles. The military gave me task and purpose. Since separating, my aggression and irritability is getting harder and harder to control. I’m loud, I demand good order and discipline in my house but rarely ever get it. I get frustrated incredibly easy, and I feel like I’m back into my teenage self where I will do anything to let the beast out of the cage. I feel like it’s putting a strain on marriage and the last thing I want is my kids to have the childhood I did but no matter how hard I try I can’t break the cycle. I would like to state I have never hit my kids like I had gotten as a child, but I do yell quite frequently. I have tried therapy since leaving the army with 5 or 6 different therapists but I keep not going back. I hate talking about my feelings or problems, I grew up in a household and military where it was ingrained in me to keep that shit in and deal with it. I havent meshed with any therapist yet.

My whole life since birth is one struggle after another.
I suffered a burnout in December of 24, I'm being laid off, I can't pay bills.
Over the last 2-3 months I got more and more overwhelmed with everything to the point of complete paralysis. My Adhd meds don't help anymore. Everything is too much even leaving the house. I'm in survival mode since forever. I jump at the smallest noise, muscles always tense. Therpy did very little.

Last week health and relationship issues got added, which brings me to the question in the title.
I had a crying fit yesterday. Felt exhausted after, but otherwise ok. Today I woke up and felt completely drained and despair. Tried to force myself to do a minor 2 minute chore. Couldn't do it, then I spilled my energy drink and had a moment of pure rage over it, threw the can across the room (I was alone) and then sat down on the bed and started hysterically crying. Everything came crashing down like a tidalwave, all the stress, all the fear, all the things I should do but put off for months now because no tips for getting stuff done works, just everything. I sat there crying and trembling and sobing ""I can't do this anymore"" on repeat for over two hours.
Now I sit here and feel weird, numb, like everything went grey, like I watch the world from outer space

MentalHealthSupport,"I (21m) have been at my college for 4 semesters now. The first 3 were really hard as I dealt with the transition from an adolescence that was really sheltered and atypical and during which I transitioned off from multiple simultaneous medications on which I’d been for years that had been hurting, not helping me, which I wasn’t able to fully quit until my 3rd semester. I was suffering so much there were multiple cold turkey attempts in my earlier semesters about which my family would always find out, which I think just scrambled my brain even more but I was so desperate to not feel the way they made me feel, although they finally accepted me not being on them. 

In the 4th semester everything seemed to be turning around, I finally made this one friend (who’s really cool) and I also began talking to this girl who while ostensibly another friend I actually had mad feelings for. What’s important is that because of my sheltered, overmedicated experience growing up, this was my first real crush/object of my romantic feelings with which I was interacting, despite me being in college. However it wasn’t ok for me keep interacting with her and presenting myself as a friend because she had a partner, granted I didn’t find out about him until 3 months of talking to her, however I could have just made an effort to find out by looking at her Instagram or something and I didn’t cause she was so cool (doing like fashion and photo shoots and stuff) it was too overwhelming because it made me feel so small. 

But the combination of the happy feelings from my new friendship and getting the attention of the girl I shouldn’t have been talking to basically gave me so much hope for the first time, I got into shape and lost a massive amount of weight which was super validating and felt really good (may have gone well into ED territory sadly, going from a BMI of around 29 to 20 in 4 months), got into running which has become a huge passion for me, actually consumed media sometimes (oftentimes I won’t like watch movies, tv, play games etc. cause I had this half-conscious feeling like it was meant for “normal humans”, not me, and that I was doing something “wrong” by engaging with it, I still get a very similar feeling with social media like Insta, Snapchat, TikTok, even YouTube which makes them super stressful and overwhelming to use thus putting me at odds with many members of my generation who love to waste time on that kind of stuff, I honestly wish I could without that shameful feeling). And more then anything all of these just made me feel for the first time like I COULD catch up with all these cool college students around me developmentally, even in spite of my past of being super emotionally volatile (before my meds just made me numb for years, and also having so much anxiety, depression, asd1. 

With the wrong meds fading from my mind and life seeming like it was moving in the right direction, my emotions began to become unlocked too for the first time in a very very long time. All of a sudden in my 4th semester of college I had all of these crazy new impulses and feelings, like “I wanna look good and have a cool aesthetic”, “I wanna laugh and make memories with friends who make me feel good”, “I really cuddle and kiss a girl like my crush”, and so on and so forth, I’d also find myself super moved by media like a kiss scene in a movie or something was so beautiful. I also begun to think of myself during this era as rather psychologically effeminate/androgynous, which fortunately I don’t see anything wrong with and in fact embrace as a cool part of myself. 

It’s worth mentioning one issue, my roommate during this period (we shared a tiny one room dorm) was really disrespectful of me, he was both super negative and nasty which just hurt my soul to be near and also would play League until at least like 2am every night being super loud, which made it difficult for me to sleep and relax. And became of my fragile, blooming state I was too intimidated and overwhelmed to confront him in any way so I just lived in this environment that didn’t feel safe for me. Which meant that during this emotional awakening I didn’t have any kind of home base. 

The thing with waking up emotionally is that the more I woke up the more in contact I felt with past traumas, this all culminated in April 2024 when I went to this campus event at my college and I processed fully for the first time all these groups of cool college students around me just hanging out with friends, I could everyone was full of memories, so I had a total breakdown and just stared at a wall for a few hours. Because now that my brain had lowered all of the dissociative defense mechanisms I could see for the first time since being a kid when I’d learned to disassociate and went on meds what I’d been missing over the course of my life. After that mental break I’m  ashamed to admit I stopped going into my room cause I was so anxious around my roommate (basically living out of my residence halls 2nd floor student lounge for 1 remaining month of the semester) I basically just walked around campus all day (I have a running watch and it says during this era I had like 20k-30k steps daily) I’d sporadically go to class enough that at the end of the semester I didn’t fail anything but other than I was kind of in this weird super dysregulated almost sedated semi-fugue state. I also gorged myself on food constantly during this month, half to feel something and half as a sort of subconscious self punishment, I gained back quite a bit of the weight I lost very quickly :/. I also stopped running during this time, which had been propping up my mental health a lot. 

What’s key is that right after my aforementioned mental breakdown I reached out to my crush whose attention meant more than anything in the world to me. I asked her if she could be someone I could talk to about how I felt mentally (about my newly rediscovered feelings of loneliness). Now almost a year later I do understand that was a really kind of inappropriate awkward position I was putting her in. However while this isn’t an excuse at my time my brain was being totally flooded with all of these rediscovered impulses for human connection and love, including platonic love, that I couldn’t think straight. At the time all I could think was that I was proud of myself for realizing for the first time that it’s ok to lean on others, and I was so blinded by that pride that I didn’t stop to ask if I was reaching out to the right person.

Anyways what happened was that she didn’t even open that text for 2 weeks (she was growing distant as she was catching on to my feelings for her, again on the basis of which it wasn’t right for me to be talking to her) and once she did open it she apologized for talking a while and said she would be a person I could talk to, but then she ghosted me, which put me in this emotional limbo which worsened my detonating mental state, however I’d like to reiterate it was not fair for me to make her my emotional home, even if she was the first person I fell for.

After leaving at the end of the semester and going back home I basically barely moved out of my bed for a couple of months, while also still being super emotionally volatile at the same time. What’s important is that I didn’t really want to get better, cause I was so happy that my emotions had reactivated, even when was in anguish I liked it cause I didn’t feel numb anymore. And I was in anguish over immature I felt, it seemed like everyone my age in college had lived lives full of memories and growth, meanwhile I’d been hella sheltered and couldn’t even DRIVE at 20. And my crush also became the symbol so to speak of being human, “unlike me”, or so it felt.

Eventually because I was still stuck on this girl I did something EXTREMELY EVIL FOR WHICH I INVITE JUDGEMENT, I texted her on a burner number with a photo of a cut on my arm and said that if you don’t get back to me I’ll keep hurting myself. She responded and said that this was way too much for her and that the things I was saying were extremely concerning. Ultimately after I stabilized a little I explained that I had had feelings for her and should not have talked to her and that the whirlwind of emotions sent me into a mental breakdown, she responded with astonishing grace, and we both peacefully agreed to longer interact. 

For the second half of the summer I found within myself a newfound hope. I got back into running which helped a lot, I got back into eating patterns and lost again the weight I regained, I finally began practicing how to drive, although I never got my license cause there wasn’t enough time from when I got my adult permit to when I went back to school. I felt really hopeful.

And for the first 2 weeks everything seemed to be going better than ever, I didn’t have a terrible roommate, I hung out with my aforementioned cool friend from the previous semester (not the girl with whom I was now no contact), I made new friends at my colleges running club and went to live music with them once which was awesome, I also tried seeing the college therapist which I found way more helpful than I expected. However a similar story unfolded, where my emotional reawakening also caused me to come back into contact with my feelings of being a perpetually immature freak, and I ended up overburdening my friend temporarily by treating him like a therapist.

Realizing that I was heading in a similar direction, I decided that I would take that academic year off to do intense mental health work. This took a lot of convincing my family cause I don’t feel comfortable being emotionally open with them, but a month after the beginning of my 5th semester I left college, and a month after that I went to residential treatment. It’s worth mentioning, the month I spent at home between leaving college and going to residential was one of the worst of my life mental health wise, but my family insisted on using a consultant to find the best treatment for me which made the whole process take that long.

I was at residential for 3 months (I do recognize that I was very fortunate to get that opportunity) but idk how good being in a lockdown environment was for me. I think it was good socially but while I really I did really enjoy some of my connections there the style of therapy didn’t really do anything to address my core insecurity of feeling somehow “lesser”/“less developed” then everyone else my age. It seemed way more so behavioral focused. And honestly it was really stressful and scary being there especially at first

After residential I went straight to a transitional program (again, I recognize I’m blessed to have this opportunity) and I’ve now been here for 2 months. I’ve been bouncing back and forth between emotional states and haven’t been stable enough to get a job even though I’m expected to, having spent a lot of time in bed. One big development, I finally am open to the idea of meds again, and 2 weeks ago I begun a mood stabilizer (Lamictal) which I feel really good about in terms of subtle effects and family members’ experiences. However I don’t feel like I’m on the path to healing from my deep rooted feeling of inferiority that impedes my ability to function.

I’m honestly so afraid that even restating (what I believe to be) the right meds this time, my brain won’t let my emotions come out like they did again, just with more regulation. That I’ll involuntarily descend into disassociation.

And that I won’t be able to go back to college in August, cause that’s where I still feel like I can learn to be a member of society, and where I can LIVE with my peers.

I wish my life had gone normally. I want to fit in.

I am 35M, based in Bangalore, India. I have a college friend, \~30F, whom this post is about – let’s call her Nikita. We were in college together during our master’s degree, and graduated in 2018. While I and her have never been particularly close friends, we were in a common friends’ group. All of us hung out together all the time, went on many trips, and even though it’s been 7 years since graduation, we’ve managed to stay in touch and meet up every now and then.

I won’t go into the smaller details, but Nikita has always seemed just a little bit… jittery, fickle… like she’s trying a bit too hard, but trying not to show… a bit difficult to explain without examples, I guess, but let’s not go into it. Suffice to say that this impression was formed from isolated ‘incidents’, well spread out. It’s just like each of us in our group has our own little confusing ‘Nikita stories’ that we would mostly just laugh about.

Back in college, I interned in a certain company, under a guy named Arjun. My internship turned into a placement offer, and I worked in that company for 4 years, although in a completely different team – never talked to Arjun again after the internship (weird, I know, but I am a big introvert). Incidentally, a few years after graduating, Nikita went on to work in the same company, and Arjun was her manager. Worked there a couple of years, then left. Came back from Delhi to Bangalore (where her family is located), took a few months’ break, then joined another company in Mumbai. Worked there for a few months’ and then left that as well, and back to Bangalore – taking a break, figuring out what’s next.

That’s the background. Long, sorry. Now, couple of months’ back, we met at a common friend’s party. I was there with my wife, who is also from the same college, was in the same friend’s group, and was actually Nikita’s room partner for a while – they’re not particularly close though. Whenever we are planning something together, Nikita contacts me rather than my wife. Anyhow, all three of us talked about jobs in general, and we gave her our opinions on what she might want to do next. Very generic conversation. Later we dropped her home in our car, continuing in the same vein. One thing that later became important was – at some point, we talked about managers sometimes saying weird things, and I casually said, “But Arjun would have never said something like that, right? I remember him being very polished,” and she said yes. That’s it, we dropped her, everything was fine, we went home.

Next day, I woke up to some late-night WhatsApp messages from her. Her tone was accusatory, and she asked why I and my wife were manipulating her into going into startups, and what exactly had I discussed with Arjun. This was completely out of the blue for me, and I responded as such. She told me not to play games, saying she knows Arjun is trying to manipulate her, directly as well as through others. I reassured her we were not doing anything like this, and repeatedly asked if she is okay. Alarm bells were already going on in my head, because this seemed like a very long, and very weird leap of logic. After a few messages back and forth, she apologized, saying there’s been a “ton of shitty things” going on over the last few years, and she thought this was the same. I asked if she wanted to talk. She said no, but then later in the day asked if she could come over to talk to me and my wife. We were out that day, but asked her to come over the next day, but it never happened. I told the whole thing to my wife, but she didn’t become particularly concerned, just saying that Nikita can be a bit strange sometimes.

I decided to keep checking in on her though, in the hope of getting her to talk about what’s going on, and eventually convincing her to see a therapist. We had a couple of short WhatsApp exchanges, spaced 7-10 days apart, where I asked her how she was, reminded her that we’re here to talk, and suggested that even if she doesn’t feel comfortable sharing with me in particular, she should share with *someone* – a friend, family, therapist. Both these conversations were cordial, friendly. After the last one, she even got some desserts delivered to me and my wife.

A few days later, when I WhatsApped her again, the message didn’t get delivered, and long story short, I realized that I had been blocked. I waited a couple of days, then tried to call her – no answer. Waited a couple of days then SMSed her, not even sure if it would get delivered. Received a message back saying she’s in no mood for friendly banter, and will reach out once things are better. I message her reiterating that neither me nor my wife will ever do anything to hurt her, that she should talk to *someone*, and that I’m here to talk/help if she wants. She says Ok.

Now, there’s a common friend #2 (CF#3) who’s getting married, and the group is making plans to attend. We create a WhatsApp group, and start adding people who are planning to join. Another CF#3 mentions Nikita won’t be joining. A different CF#4 calls Nikita up to ask why, and she literally shouts at him to stop colluding with me to manipulate her. He has no idea about any of this, and is taken aback, tries to reason with her, but she shuts him down. He then calls me and tells me about it, and I tell him what I know. Both of us are concerned, and we call up CF#3. CF#3 was in Mumbai when Nikita was there, and while she is conflicted about sharing things Nikita told her in confidence, she is concerned too, and does end up disclosing some stuff.

Nikita has a twin sister, and an elder brother. Nikita told CF#3 that the older brother is a patriarchal, male chauvinist type asshole who believes women are inferior to men, should stay at home to serve, and has said repeatedly that ‘allowing’ Nikita to pursue higher education was a mistake. The parents are mild, and tend to fall in line behind the aggressive brother. Per Nikita, since childhood, he has been sabotaging her and her sister’s success, in a behind-the-scenes kind of way (no further details). And lately, Nikita has been seeing the same pattern in her professional life. Per her, she had to leave companies A and B because someone somehow reached out to her managers and maligned her character (no further details). She feels that she is being spied on – that her devices might be hacked into, and someone might be sending things from her email, then deleting them off. To the extent that when she had this conversation with CF#3, it was out in a park, and she had left her phone at home. But she could not show CF#3 any evidence, because that would be “going against her family”. In Mumbai, she briefly dated a guy, but became convinced that he was coming over to her house behind her back; got cameras installed, didn’t find anything.

I am not trained in psychology or anything. But after that first initial weird WhatsApp exchange itself, the first thought that had come to my mind was she might be verging on a mental disorder. The word that appeared in my mind was schizophrenia, but on reading up a bit more, it seems to me more Paranoid Personality Disorder than schizophrenia. To re-emphasize though – I have no formal knowledge of these disorders, only what I could quickly gather from the internet. But this last conversation convinces me that something is wrong. To add to the complications, it turns out that when she left for Mumbai from Bangalore, she did not even tell her family she was leaving. Currently, she’s not living with her parents, but with her sister (for my non-Indian friends – this is not as obvious a choice in India as it is in Western countries), and I now doubt if she’s even told her family she’s back in Bangalore? Another detail: back in 2021, she was set to get married, but eventually the marriage was called off – maybe because Nikita was not able to trust the guy enough.

Sidetracking just a little bit to talk about myself. I think I am a fairly empathetic person. While I am not very social, and a bit too “proper” or even “diplomatic”, my friends and family often divulge their problems with me; and I feel I am able to offer them emotional comfort at least. I am bad at keeping in touch though.

Against all of this backdrop, now, what do I do?

While I have not been super close with Nikita, I do have a soft spot for her. As in, even before all this, I hoped she would find whatever she was looking for, that she could be happy. The thought of her struggling with whatever this is, is deeply disturbing for me. The more I read about PPD, the scarier and sadder it sounds. I imagine her sitting in her apartment, unsettled by everything that she perceives as threats. And what makes me want to do something the most, is the fact that I don’t know if anyone else is there for her right now or not. Had there been a husband, or her family, or even a boyfriend in the picture, I might not have felt about it so strongly. But as things are, it seems almost like my responsibility to try to do something.

Since I was not yet blocked on SMS, couple of days back I sent her a long, heartfelt text saying clearly that we – me, my wife, CF#4 – all care for her, and are concerned for her. While we respect her space, we think whatever is troubling her is becoming more serious – and as her friends, it should be our right as well as responsibility to help her. Practically begged her to trust us. She said “All that’s fine, but right now I need my space. Please do not think of it as rude”, and blocked me.

Now, I have no way of contacting her. I know the building she lives in, but not the exact apartment. None of us have contacts to her sister or parents. Next weekend, incidentally CF#4 is here in Bangalore as well. It seems like a desperate measure, but I am half in the mind to just turn up at her place with CF#4. I am aware that this can backfire completely. But I can’t just leave her be. Things seem to be unravelling quickly.

MentalHealthSupport,"I have had this friend since we were preteens, and at this point I'm so lost on how to talk to them or what to even do to help them I'm close to throwing in the towel. I've started feeling rather resentful towards them which I feel horrible for, but I just have no idea what else to do or what to say to them that might make a difference. So I've come here hoping that maybe someone has some input on this, or that I'm just approaching things from the wrong angle. Really any help at all would be super appreciated - I care for them a lot and I want to help them.

  
For some context: This friend has always been timid and socially awkward, but has gotten worse and worse over time - they can basically not talk to strangers at all. They are morbidly obese and clearly hate their weight, being incredibly self-deprecating about 'how fat they are', but then don't try to do anything to address the issue / come up with excuses on why they can't do the things people suggest they could try. They are like this in most areas of their life, which I understand is probably due to their depression, but it does mean that my main strategy of helping people - offering advice and support - just doesn't work with them.

  
They are very open about the fact that I'm the only friend they have and have essentially changed life plans in order to not move to a different country for their education (as was their original plan) just so they can stay with their only friend more. They are also very openly self-deprecating in their language around me, no matter what I say, and they have self-harmed / attempted suicide a few times before.

  
I hang out with them every week, and I message them semi-regularly to see if they want to play any games or something, but they usually don't reply to said messages. Being physically there for them more often than that would not be possible without me putting other areas of my life on hold, as they live a while away and I'm busy with my own life - plus, and I admit I am very ashamed of this, but I don't think I could handle being their emotional support person every day. My own mental health isn't that great either, and I'm hesitant to add even more strain onto it.

  
They are not currently seeing a therapist and have brushed off the idea when suggested to them. They used to take antidepressants but I believe they stopped a while ago. I have tried offering them we could do things together more (they're usually too busy), we could do exercise together from time to time (saying that I actually need an accountability buddy myself, which is true!), we could go grocery shopping together from time to time to hang out, but none of those things have worked. I'm their friend, I include them in things I do with other friends of mine (though what we can do with them around is limited due to their weight), I have offered advice on how they could try to handle problems they're having, I have offered to study with them when they were struggling in a subject I'm good at. None of this has worked - outside of hanging out with me from time to time, everything else I've tried has been rejected.

  
I'm sorry this got so long. People I've asked about this have told me to just let them be - you can't help them if they don't want to help themselves - but I know that depression is a bitch and they're not in a position to be helping themselves right now. I just hope that there is still something I could do to help them have a positive impact on their lives, as the way things are going right now, they are probably not even going to be able to find a job.

MentalHealthSupport,"I'm cracking under the pressure. Tiny things are tipping me over to being emotional. I'm on my monthly, but this week just has hit me so freaking hard. I'm trying to recover. I feel lonely and bored. I want to find my happiness again, but nothing ever lines up. 

At work, I'm always the exception as someone has to cover the front desk. So I have to wait to get my break until my coworker can come. And she's not doing it on purpose, she's stuck in a work call. But I'm waiting. I could go get someone else, but no one really wants the front desk and I guess I'm just rather wait for her than get questioned by those outside of my department. When there's a schedule change, it's ""you have to agree with her on what days you can take off."" And I just feel like I'm always asking for favors, but no one is ever asking me for favors. So I end up feeling like a begger. They are supposed to be changing things around but the manager hasn't looked into into a new phone system. Half of my coworkers work from home, and I'm only allowed 2 days compared to my cover, whose allowed the entire week. I guess makes sense I'm the receptionist, but I never wanted to be the only receptionist, they always made it sound like there was going to be 3 of us, but now it's just me and the former receptionist and a payroll clerk. And I have to figure out my breaks and lunches between them or my days off. 

I ask for more work, the manager asks the team, but I never get more work. So I'm doing this monthly task and since I'm the only one, it demotivates me as I'm trying to ration out how much I will do each day to leave me something. And I guess I hope they will notice that I'm not doing everything and get another person to come help me. I know this sounds weird, but as I'm asking for more work but then leaving work undone until the deadline. But otherwise I don't have anything else. 

I feel distant with my friends and family. Grandma in the hospital. Brother dropped out of high school this week. He's depressed. Trying to make me and him not depressed anymore. 

I only see my husband for 2 hours a day, which is when we eat and cook. So I can't plan anything after work to met with friends. It seems too late to go out at 8pm. Not many options and my friends go to bed early. So now I'm bothered that I can't go do friend stuff because of my husband. But then I'm bothered I can't see my husband because of the work schedule. 

Then money has been a pinched. I used my IRA to cover my credit card. But that is just one out of 3. There's always something. And not enough for something else. We get by. We go on dates (ie a movie and take out ever 2 weeks, nothing grand, just something to get me out of the house). But then we have to delay haircuts or car repairs or medical checkups. 

I don't have any passions to do at home. I'm bored. I default to crafts but there's no joy. I call my husband but there's no fun conversations just ""we need to buy this"" ""with what money????""

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something personal I’ve been struggling with lately and would love some advice. I’ve always been someone who strives to do things perfectly, whether it’s school, work, or even personal projects. While this might seem like a good thing at first, I’ve noticed it has started to impact my mental health and daily life.

For example, when I start a new task, I spend so much time planning and trying to get everything perfect from the beginning that it ends up delaying progress or even stopping me from finishing things. I constantly feel like what I do isn’t good enough, and this mindset has led me to put off things I know I should be doing.

The worst part is that it makes me doubt myself constantly, even when I do achieve something. I’ve been trying to let go of this pressure I put on myself, but it’s tough. I’m afraid of making mistakes and failing, and I get frustrated when things don’t turn out exactly how I envisioned them.

Has anyone here struggled with perfectionism? How do you manage it and stop it from holding you back? Any advice on how to accept imperfections and not let them control my life would be really helpful!

my heartrate increases( i have never actually measured it but i can feel it). i feel like vomiting and that weird sense of fear washes my mind like for example- you just found out your son gambled all your live savings and you had a heart surgery the very next day or you find out your wife has hired goons to unnnalive you and they are already at the door.. i hope yall get the idea.

this does not last much longer maybe shorter than a minute and when the feeling of un easiness is gone so is the memory, but the idea or words that eventually triggered the memory stays.

MentalHealthSupport,"Thoughts? -What do you do when you’re alone with no one to talk to? You talk to yourself. And I’ve been so alone that my own voice became a knife in the silence that surrounded me. It felt foreign and sharp in contrast to the empty space I constantly occupied. So instead of talking to myself, I write online, typing thoughts like confessions into the void in the hopes that someone, anyone, might echo back something other than the pain Im trying to exorcise from myself.

Depression doesn’t always look like pale skin, dark circles, and messy hair. Sometimes, it looks like a perfectly normal girl sitting  in her living room, doing everything she can to seem fine. I’ll never forget the stranger who came to my apartment one night. It was supposed to be a date, but I canceled in the most honest way I could because I was simply, utterly exhausted from hiding that I was not okay. I hadn’t been okay for a long time, and I couldn’t pretend I was anymore . I told him I was struggling with thoughts of suicide and couldn’t bring myself to leave my apartment.  he asked if he could still come over—if I would still have him. I remember staring at that message, thinking maybe he hadn’t actually read mine, or at least not all of it. So I asked again, plainly—did you see what I said? Did you see what I said? That I’m not okay. That I’m struggling to stay alive today. He hadn’t. He missed the part where I confessed the weight I’d been carrying. When he finally read it, I told him that I wouldn’t hold it against him if he chose not to come. And I had meant it I know people feel pressure in these moments—there’s a sense of panic, of moral responsibility. Most people don’t want someone to end their life, but they also don’t know what to say or how to be in the room with that kind of truth. And honestly, I’m glad some people don’t understand. Even if it’s why people like me are often judged or dismissed or met with awkward silence—it means they haven’t had to carry this weight. And I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. This isn’t romantic. It’s not poetic. It’s not  martyrdom , or some glamorous kind of sadness. It’s a slow rot. It’s something that gnaws at the foundation of you until your body remains but you’re no longer inside it. It’s destructive. And when he said he still wanted to come over, I let him. I didn’t clean up or change. I stayed in the same clothes I’d been wearing. When I opened the door, I tried to keep my face neutral, blank not for me, but for him. I didn’t want to make him uncomfortable. I was numb. My body was tired. My spirit felt worn through. The apartment was dim, too quiet, too still like a tomb. I had moved my life into the living room because the bedroom felt like it was swallowing me whole. There was no clutter, just a hollowed-out kind of order—essentials and nothing more. When he looked at me, the first thing he said was, “You don’t look like someone struggling with wanting to die.” And something in me flinched. I didn’t know what I had expected, but it wasn’t that. For a second I wondered, Is that what people think? When they see me? When they see anyone? What does someone look like when they’re collapsing inside? I looked him in the eye and asked, “Is there some way you have to look to feel that way?” Depression doesn’t wear a uniform. It doesn’t always show up in ways you can see. Sometimes it looks like chaos. Sometimes it looks like disintegration. And sometimes it looks just like i did that night standing blank-faced at the door, breathing through dying on the inside while trying not to make it weird for the guy standing on the welcome mat.
At the lowest points of my depression, it’s wild to me that it was when  I received the most compliments on my appearance. I was the thinnest I had ever been, and that includes the times when I was deep in active eating disorders and drug abuse. I went from 210 pounds down to 120 in four months. I’d look at myself in the mirror and i could no longer  recognize the hollowed-out person looking back at me.  My body matched what i felt like inside, like I was shrinking out of my life. People smiled at me like wasting away was an accomplishment I was now achieving . No one saw the  screaming that the change really was . they just saw someone who had been overweight becoming skinny. And that was “a good thing.” I was praised for silently drowning. 

I understand how helpless it feels to care about someone who’s suicidal. You want to help. You want to take their pain away. But you can’t. I know that powerlessness. But I also know what it’s like to be on the other side, to be silently pleading for someone to see me. To not tell me my feelings are wrong. To not tell me I’m overreacting. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve said, “I don’t feel loved,” and people have rushed to say, “But you are loved,” “There are people who love you,” as if my suffering was something I choose to feel As if I were being dramatic. Ungrateful. Blind to what’s right in front of me.

I’ve stood in both places. And I still can’t tell you definitively what the right way to be is. But what  I can say is: sometimes the right thing isn’t a thing at all. It’s simply presence. just… someone actively being there. 

I get that many people don’t know how to sit with me in my pain. But God… I wonder do they ever step outside their own skin even for a moment, to wonder what it’s like for me to live in it? I can’t escape it. I can’t soothe it. It doesn’t stay stuffed away. It’s always there, persistent, aching, taking the coloring from everything. No one can see it. And that’s its own kind of pain. Because I feel it… but their criticisms of how I react to what they think just doesn’t exist makes me question if I’m even really feeling it at all. Until I begin to gaslight myself
I can’t describe to you the tragedy of experiencing so much humanity within myself, and yet being convinced I’m fabricating it. Like it’s if I’m stabbing myself and crying for help, but everyone’s too busy pointing out that the knife is in my hand to notice that I’m bleeding out.

I know everyone has something going on that no one else knows about. We’re all stumbling through this life for the first time. And none of us really knows what we’re doing here. Sometimes, that thought comforts me. It softens the sting when people let me down. Other times, it makes me feel completely bleak and nihilistic. Because I know, no one is coming to save me. And no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to save myself.

I don’t blame anyone.

MentalHealthSupport,"I (M 19) have essentially been held to the highest standard my entire life. My family has always said that the most important thing is grades and academics, to the point of keeping me out of sports and extracurricular activity so I could focus on my studies. I was always harshly punished for falling short of grades (anything below a 90% was considered failure in my household) and was always told that I would be great. This has been a constant in my life as long as I could remember, this idea that I would one day be someone who goes down in history. I kid you not I once told my parents I was only 18 and I was doing pretty good compared to most and was told “Alexander was 18 when he was toppling nations” (which isn’t true by the way) “you don’t have an excuse” This idea was reinforced when I got into the gifted program at my school at a young age where, I was never directly told, but it was heavily implied that I was “going places” and I was destined for more than my classmates. 
This was all fine and dandy until I got to college, where, egged on my parents because of the future career benefits, I decided to join Greek life, something that I was always told would help my to achieve my dreams. This posed a couple of issues because, 1, I was a nerd who had never been allowed to play sports and didn’t have any social skills, and 2, I had learned that the only way to be good enough was by being the best. The fraternity i joined is well regarded and fairly large, but not the best on my campus, something that makes me feel awful regularly. I quickly began to realize that I wasn’t the smartest anymore, not only this but the people around me were better looking and more confident than I could ever be. This was around the time that, for the first time in my life, in my freshman year of college, I got a C in a class, I need to emphasize how devastating this was for me, at this point I had never studied, didn’t pay attention and had been thought that i wouldn’t have to because I was me. My parents immediately cut my financial support, leading to the need for me to get a full time job on top of everything.
My life feels like it’s falling apart, and I don’t know why. Whenever I confide in someone about my deep insecurities, they are often surprised because from the outside, I’m doing quite well, I have decent grades, I’m fairly attractive (though I can’t see it), I’ve made great strides in social development, and everyone seems to love me. But for some reason I berate myself for being constantly inadequate, because I can’t measure up to everyone around me, I’m not the best at anything, I’m average and it’s the closest feeling to physical pain I can explain. Since this feeling started I’ve seen mental health professionals and been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, depression, and narcissistic tendencies.

Already at the age of 4 I was hit by both my parents. Long story short they ""were"" stupid and is ""trying"" to make thinks better. The last time my dad hardcore assaulted me was when I was 12-13.

I've was suicidal from 10 to a while ago. I stopped being suicidal because in a few months I have a chance to move out to my grandparents to study in university. I want to be able to make to be successful despite of my upbringing and be able to insult them before I'm able to completely cut ties with them. My mom warned and manipulated me to now tell anyone how they treated me. The reasons why I still haven't reported them is because they put up with my abnormal sleeping habits and lets me be, and I have alot of chronic dieses but my dad disturbs me if I dont respect his authority or whatever that guy does in need for validation.

He just barged into my room and screamed at me because I didn't wanna talk to him and hung up the phone abruptly. I'm not upset that he was yelling at me but because I have to put up with this until next semester. He yelled I wasn't raised well (insult in my home language) as if that was someone else's job, I yelled at him he didn't raise me at all and just hit me at the age of 4.

I said at that age I don't know any better and he replied ""at that age you know lots"" like what???

(TW! Mentions of self harm and sexual assault) 

Let me just start by saying I have been assaulted 4+ times in my life and in the back of my mind there's always a thought saying ""it has to be your fault at this point, NOBODY gets assaulted THAT many times"" and it hurts. My most recent one ended with me having a miscarriage to a r@pe baby. From my main assaulter, we'll call this person Neptune. (Neptune is not their real name) I was in love with Neptune for so long and from what they told me, they were in love with me too. The first assault with them started in seventh grade, they were a sophomore in high school. 

I wont give many details on the assault because it's a well known story of that person and people I know might find this post. But it happened at a party, and after I was traumatized to say the least. This person I had loved for so long had completely violated me. I still talked to them for a while after that. It was really hard to break away from them because of the trauma bond that had formed after that incident. But months later I finally did, after I had successfully blocked them I didn't talk to them for months.More than a year, but we went to the same school now, I was a freshman and she was a senior. I knew we would eventually cross paths and I was fully prepared to defend myself from her if she tried anything. But I grew weak. My friends and I would go to a local library after school every day and Neptune also went there. 

I tried to ignore her presence at first but we kept staring at each other. And I remember one day my friend waved to Neptune, they knew what had transpired a year ago but they had asked for permission to interact with Neptune because they liked her outfit. I was okay with it but I didn't know this would cause Neptune to come back into my life. This friend of mine let's call him Agreste. He wanted Neptune's number and after a lot of asking eventually I caved and gave it to him. This then led to me thinking, ""maybe Neptune's changed! It's been so long!"" and I spent ages trying to come up with a reason to text them, which I eventually did (how dumb of me I know) and for a while, I mean a really long while, things were great! I really thought they had changed... But Neptune did not change. 

During a day in which we were both heading to the school because of a mandatory performance (both of us were in Choir) we were talking and she texted me saying if I see her going somewhere alone I should follow her so we could talk. I payed no mind to it at first but when it came the time during the show where I saw her going up the school stairs alone and she motioned for me to follow her, I knew I had to make a choice. I mad the wrong choice and I regret it to this day. The things she did to me in that school bathroom were horrible and vile. I hate myself and my body after that event. I ended up pregnant and miscarried after. She didn't care. But because of that pregnancy I met someone amazing. 

My current partner, we'll call him Luca. He provided me with a plan b pill a couple days after the incident. (Obviously it didn't work but I felt so safe and seen after that) That was my first encounter with him. From that day on, I was attached. And we started dating later that month. I realize now that we never got to really know each other. We never had deep conversations or experiences with each other. Since Neptune I haven't been able to heal because I instantly fell in love and continued living life. And for a while it really did help! I was even encouraged to report the assault and now I'm going through the process of prosecution, but the truth is I'm not okay. 

I haven't been to school in weeks. My grades are shit. My boyfriend feels unloved. I feel like shit. My main reason for coming on here is because of my mental health. Neptune has completely broken me. She has used me for her own pleasure and manipulated me because I am naive and young. It hurts. I am broken. I can't even speak and this reason alone is what's tearing apart my relationship. I can't handle questions anymore. I am so hypersensitive and I don't know why this is all crashing down on me so suddenly. Every time my partner asks me a question I respond with ""I don't know."" And I really don't know. I have become so indecisive and confused I don't know anything. 

If Im asked a lot of questions that aren't yes or no then I start clawing at my legs, subconsciously scratching at my skin because it drives me crazy hearing questions, all I can say is I don't know and then when he doesn't want to hear I don't know I just start sobbing. And hurting myself. Today I started hitting my phone against my bed frame. I had a burst of outrage. And I feel so numb. I feel like I'm nothing anymore. All I can PHYSICALLY say is ""I don't know."" That's all I know how to say. I feel like I need to learn how to talk again. I don't know what's wrong with me. My response to this trauma is breaking me when I'm already broken. It's not just hurting me, it's hurting my relationship. I need help and I am not okay. I can't ask to go to a mental hospital because I'm scared. I can't ask for help and I don't know what to do.. I don't know anything anymore. 

To clarify something really quickly; My assaulter is transfem, she was born a male but transitioned to a female. She still has her pee pee stick though which is how I ended up pregnant. 

I am just lost with myself and I have no idea what to do. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't get up and shower or even brush my teeth. I just want to be happy again. I want to be happy with him again.. 

To end this I want to apologize if this post is all over the place, I just needed to get it all out and this was the only way I knew how. All names are fake in this and I'm sorry if this is triggering or breaks any rules",I'm really not okay.,1743176719.0,1jly3y7
MentalHealthSupport,"My boyfriend and I started dating within the last year. Things are amazing and he's amazing. However there is a little voice/ feeling in the back of my mind constantly that says something isn't right. 

I've been cheated on and lied to in literally every relationship I've ever been in. I don't want to think that he would cheat or lie but I'm still so guarded and scared. Cheaters will always find a way and liars will always lie. Narsassistic people are dangerous because they will gaslight you into believing whatever it is that they want you to believe. They will fabricate their own version of a true reality for you until your not sure which way is up and what to believe and what is fact or fiction.

On one hand, if he is truthful and faithful then I'll finally have the chance to have a real loving family of my own.

On the other hand, I could be setting myself up to just be another discarded baby mama. He could just dip the second I get pregnant or deal until the baby is born. He could be looking for ways to find another woman who is prettier, who's body is better, whos more exciting... Then it would jaut be me and a baby that reminds me of the horrible lies he put me through. I wouldn't have the heart to explain that to my child. As someone who never knew their own father, I always voewd to never let my child be without a parent. But I also don't want to have to do this alone and put on a brace face if he only wanted me for another child and not to actually be with me.

MentalHealthSupport,"I am 38. I was only diagnosed with autism last year. 

One of the harsh realities of autism is basically you are told you are different and other people do not see the world the way you see it.

Nothing like being an adult and being told you will never quite fit in. 

At first it explains a lot. Like why no girl has ever liked me. And it explains how despite trying to get into a relationship over and over again I got nowhere.

The next thought is a bit more concerning though. What if no one ever likes me? What if I will always be completely isolated and alone? I certainly know finding someone to connect with and relate with will be a titanic struggle.

I guess the other tough aspect that I have never seen expressed anywhere is that I cannot use my own thoughts as a guide to explain the action of others. I think normally we understand others through ourselves. 

Since I am so different from others it seems very difficult for me to look inward to explain the action of others. Which is exactly what I had been doing all my life. And now that I know I am at least a little bit different.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello, 

So I have had a string of traumatic events, going back almost 2 years at this point. It has gotten to the point I question whether im getting punk'd by some kind of supernatural entity. 

I had a journal going that i was sharing with my ex.  The idea being I could get out all of my crazy in my journal instead of it spilling out into the real world. A lot of it was about her but not everything,  probably a good 70/30, becoming less and less as I got things out of my system. She could choose to hear what I say or not. She never had to look. Anything  pertaining directly to her I covered in a spoiler tag so she didn't even have to see it on accident. She would then open the thread to trip the read reciept. She agreed to this without hesitation.

And It worked. I didn't know for sure whether she was reading or not, but I knew that I had said what I needed to say and she had the chance to see it if she wanted to. That was enough. I didn't feel the need to rant and rave in front of her anymore. And I trusted her with my innermost thoughts and insecurities. 

I don't trust her anymore. 

I erased the old journal, and I started a new one last night. I barely had gotten into it when I realized it didn't feel right. Apparently, the venting isn't effective unless I at the very least think someone else may have read it. 

There's no one else in my life that I would trust with such an intimate look into my head.  In fact, getting someone to let me talk and get things off my chest has been one of the biggest hurdles of the past 6 months or so. Both friends and professionally. 

I need to be heard. Or at the very least think I have been. Otherwise it's going to start spilling out into every aspect of my life. I've never had a good filter.

I need this. 

And that's where you come in random stranger! I don't have to trust you. I don't know you, you don't know me. I can be completely honest. 

I'm looking for the same arrangement I had with my ex. I've got a group chat, it's on telegram. I'll add you. You are free to read the whole thing. You can even respond if you wish but it's not necessary. All I ask is that you occasionally open the thread so the read receipts trip, so they look like they've been seen. 

I figured this would be a decent thread to ask this, since the members seem to be both understanding, and interested in other people's problems. if I have violated any of the subreddits rules, let me know and I'll look elsewhere. I didn't see any rule against it when I looked over them but honestly I just skimmed. 

A word of caution, I use speech to text and the threads are pretty stream of consciousness, and I don't censor myself at all. If you are easily triggered, or not comfortable with people in a dark place, you probably shouldn't offer your services. 

Let me know if you are interested. Thanks if you read this far :-)",Need a random stranger,1743187393.0,1jm2b2s

I have no desire to create friends or any meaningful relationship because these dark thoughts I have will eventually creep past this fake persona I have created for myself. I tell everyone lies and it’s not always for any reason, I just lie so no one knows the truth about me and I know I’m a narcissist and a constant lier. In my head I’m looking for an excuse to do someone harm and it’s only by incredible self control I have yet to do anything.

Looking back through my childhood I have come to the conclusion that I suffered when I was a child. While I’m not willing to share details here trust me when I say I’ve been hit, emotionally broken and abused. Thinking now I’ve never been a happy person since I was young.

I’m in fear I need real help, I’m not trying to diminish anyone else and their problems but I realise I am a true threat and when that day comes that I do slip up just one time I know I won’t be able to go back.

MentalHealthSupport,"I'm a m27, autistic (only mentioning because it may be relevant).

I really struggle to care about other people's interests and passions, so I can come off aloof or uncaring. Sometimes it's easier to lie and feign interest to smooth over a conversation but that doesn't seem like a great long term strategy.

When people panic or cry around me I have to suppress the feeling of annoyance that they can't just pull themselves together. It makes it really hard to maintain relationships, both romantic and otherwise. When people need a shoulder to cry on i can be spikey.

It's come to a head today when my gf was crying after I used the wrong tone. I apologised if I sounded frustrated, and said it was me and not her and that I probably needed some time on my own after work. When she started to explain how she felt I could feel the battle start within myself to pay attention. When she started to cry I could feel myself getting annoyed, although I try to not let any of this show.

I love my gf, I just don't give a toss about her friends or whatever. I'm glad that she has friends. They're super important to her. So is her work which is nice. She has a lot of great qualities. I just want to know she is okay without all the excess irrelevant details.

I know this perspective isn't normal. My mum has told me as much. I don't know what to do however. It's nothing personal against my friends, family or gf - far from it. It's that I don't care about what they think or do. As long as they are happy.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hey guys i’m in a bit of a situation and I want to know how to navigate this. Background info i’m 20f and currently i’ve been withdrawn from school. Around a month ago i tried taking my life. I was withdrawn from school but i wasn’t made aware of it until 3 weeks in and we already found a place for me to stay. Basically the issue is i’m not in school but i’m living in an apartment paid by my parents for me to be close to school. Now me not being enrolled is on me, i had a horrible incident that i won’t get into details but long story short, horrible experience in my first year (witnessing sewer slide, attempted murder, abuse etc.) all on my own it caused me to not perform well in my classes and i was incredibly mentally i’ll - i’m not making that an excuse for my faliures but just the reason and i take full accountability of it. ( I can always clarify if you guhs have questions). This issue is, i cannot tell my parents, that’s literally a non-negotiable i’ve tried and it never ends well. My parents are indian immigrants and they’ve worked their butts off for me, please know i feel guilty about it all the time, i appreciate their help so much but they also are not the type to understand mental health and the second they get angry they don’t care. (ex. mom blamed brothers depression on me, told me dad once i was suicidal when i was younger and. he comforted me for him to then deny that ever happening and that i have no reason to feel that way and it’s my fault). What i’m trying to say is I can’t tell them that i have severe depression, anxiety and ptsd that resulted in my failing because to them that wouldn’t be an excuse. You guys might try to convince me and maybe this is where i’m being dense but i just know my parents and it wouldn’t work. They are not open minded at all, and to a getter their anger is justified becuase i’ve wasted all their hard earned money even though yes it was out of my control i still could’ve done something, i shouldn’t have been so weak. Onto why I’m making this post, when i tried, i was found by my mom and taken to the hospital. There they kept me overnight and i explained this exact situation to my psychiatrist and nurses. However when i had my meeting with my psychiatrist he told me he’s going to tell my parents there and then, i managed to convince him not to but he followed up with saying that I need to meet him in a month (currently now in like a week or so-ish) and if i haven’t told them, he’s going to send an anonymous message to my mom saying i failed uni. Now here’s the issue, i absolutely understand that in his pov this is the safest route for me but i know my family will be ruined with this info and my parents will lose it. I’ve reflected and i know that this isn’t something i want to die over so i’ll relay that info to my psychiatrist but i also somehow need to explain that after he threatened me with telling me parents, i tried this month to hint at my situation and they’ve completely shut it down. They act like what happened didn’t ever happen. My mom has blamed me and made it about herself, just very typical i don’t believe in mental health actions. But i wanted to know, I also understand there is pt confidentiality systems set in place and him threatening only just increased my anxiety. The whole time we spoke he only continued to shame me and my feelings and mitigate them. I understand having a blunt and real approach is sometimes necessary for pts but he was completely rude and dismissive. I’m really nervous that when i go back he’s going to ignore what i say and put me into a bigger problem, i feel very lost i don’t know where to post this or where to go. If anyone has advice i’ll greatly appreciate it. I know it might seem confusing and i apologize but i will do my best to clarify anything and if you guys know where else i could post this for help too.

MentalHealthSupport,"Almost 10 years ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

When I was a kid my school said I had ADHD. But no medical professional confirmed.

About 7 years ago I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. 

And just recently i was diagnosed with PTSD.

Add to that, that I was always over sensitive to noises and now get mad if I feel ‘overwhelmed’ by music, or something in the background like the lights buzzing… 

I’m just kinda lost. I have all these labels being thrown at me and I don’t know if any or all and more are right. 

I am a female, so I hear lots about woken not getting diagnosed properly when younger? 

It’s gotten particularly overwhelming for me as I have very low energy and focus issues. I like to listen to YouTube videos or audio books, to help me zone out and focus, but then I hit a certain point where even that overwhelms me and I want to cry. 

I even get anxiety attacks about watching a new episode of a show I’m going through, because I don’t know what to expect. I only want to watch stuff I’ve already seen if I feel like that. 

It really does make me feel super messed up and like all these hopelessness and helplessness I feel. Add to it I lost my job and am physically disabled and I just feel like a burden.

It is paralyzing. I just don’t feel like I have it in me to do much of anything, and if I ‘push through’ I feel completely spent. Like I got nothing left and need to sleep. Today I wasn’t even up to pouring a bowl of cereal. It literally felt like too much work. 

I guess I wanted to post this to see if anyone relates? (Which a part of me hopes you don’t because I wouldn’t wish this on anyone), but also so I don’t feel insane. Battling this invisible enemy no one else sees, you know? 

Sorry for the length, I’d do a TLDR, but wouldn’t know how to summarize it.

MentalHealthSupport,"I'm male-presenting, 23, and live at home. My home life is terrible; just cut and dry terrible, and I despise most of my family for either being racist, homophobic, stupid, entitled, narcissistic- or for in general just having ruined each others lives. I *was* employed basically as soon as I came out of college, and due to my mental health I really struggled to keep that job; sleeping-in past the start of my shift, not being able to force the happy-go-lucky energy needed for it- and though these things weren't a good look, the owner was thankfully pretty lenient about it all, as I'd been training there for, like, 15 years before working there. For context, my first job was as a Kickboxing Instructor; I was grandfathered into the role because taking a job there was part of the training once you hit 3rd Dan.

But for reasons I can't explain, and can only blame myself for (when realistically I know there were a thousand other issues with that place before I got the position I did), once I was a full time instructor- attendance started dropping and eventually they couldn't afford to pay me a wage anymore. That, and the building manager doubled the cost of their unit. I stopped going after that, because it just felt awkward- and after having trained there for so many years I was just really tired of it all.

That, and the attitude they gave me surrounding the disability they also technically gave me, really put me off of them as people. During a day of training I was flipped onto the mats and trapped my sciatic nerve in my back muscles, crushing it. Went to physio and they were able to get my muscles to release it, but it's been permanently crippled. I now have pain in my back, and legs, and sometimes everywhere else- which I will have for the rest of my life- and performing any form of manual labour makes it worse.

They refused to let me take a walking stick with me onto the mats to teach with, despite me being sensible with it and never using or holding it inappropriately. I needed and still need it to support my legs whenever my pain is bad, which again is caused by great amounts of physical activity. They somehow thought that I would be able to teach better if I didn't have it? As if removing it from my person would magically make me able to still teach to the level I used to teach at, before I fucked up my body? After it'd happened, I'd been trying to adapt my teaching style to be less active, and more observant and guiding, but that wasn't *their* style apparently.

Anyway, so guess whose second job was legitimately purely manual labour! I worked in a warehouse as a picker and packer, where I was forced to load and unload heavy boxes of random shit day in and day out for two months- before I nearly walked in front of a fork lift because the days had started to blend together so badly, I felt as if I had never actually left the warehouse at the end of the day. That, and I was yelled at about not being able to move as fast as everyone else on the hot glue assembly line, after having gotten said hot glue on my fucking hand, while my muscles were seizing from the nerve pain. This, by a manager who I had told three times by that point, that I was disabled- and needed to be put on the slower tasks if they wanted things to go smoothly. I despise people with a passion; having to interact with other people that aren't a part of my immediate friend group is tiring, unfulfilling, grating and downright anxiety-induced agony. It all just feels so fake.

It was ultimately the bleach truck that made me leave that position though. One of the jobs is to just unload unventilated lorries containing mountains of bleach products. They give you a P90 mask and goggles, and neither are enough.

You might wonder why *that* was my next place of employment though, considering I'd been to both college and University! Well, that was because I got my degree in Film and Television Production. Because I'm a fucking idiot. I'd assumed I was going to be with the Kickboxing Academy forever, and despite my disagreement with how things were run, as well as my overall mental health- it was the one job I've had so far that I could tolerate. It was also a 3 minute walk from my house, so if I overslept I could sprint there and be on time for my shift.

I was not with them forever, however. I'd chosen to do the stupid thing of getting a degree in one of my passions, instead of something that would actually make me money- because I'd hoped that I'd never have to *use* my degree. It is worth noting here however, that I wasn't even necessarily passionate about Film and TV Production either- it was just one of two choices put before me when going to college that elicited any form of reaction out of my soul, that had remained unimpressed, uncaring and acted ignorant to every other choice put before it as an option.

The last wall I have in my defense against swallowing pills or walking out into traffic, is that I have never turned my passion into my job. There is one- *one-* job that I *know* I would be happy, and capable, of doing. If I had to wake up every morning and my job was *video editor* for *anyone* other than myself, I'd kill myself. I feel the need to curl my whole body around this little corner of enjoyment I have managed to somehow find, and if the rest of the outside world ever touches it the agony I would feel and the desolate emptiness that would carve out the place where my heart should be, would disqualify me from ever feeling a spark of passion again. 

Since leaving the warehouse, I have applied for one-hundred and twenty-two jobs, ranging from data entry, to sports coach, to cctv operator- to all other mad, cockamamie positions that I couldn't give less shits about. Of those one-hundred and twenty-two positions, I have had an interview with two. Just two. And one of the companies told me to show up, after they knew it was £500 for me to travel there for the weekend to work and then go home, only to ghost me and force me to find out from the person they'd hired, that someone else got the job.

The other was a Psychic Hotline, that earns me less in a month when you do the math, than I get on Universal Credit.

The bastards that have the *audacity* to tell me I'm not trying hard enough! To accuse me of scheming and plotting to stay on Universal Credit, instead of getting a fucking job- when they can see how many fucking jobs I've applied for- because they require you to document every fucking job that you do! My work coach told me to my face that she thought there was something suspicious about me being on Universal Credit for so long because I'm so well educated- and had the audacity to claim I wasn't looking for positions hard enough!

You know what she listed as evidence? That fact that I hadn't applied for SENIOR fucking positions, using my degree that is both UNDER-QUALIFIED for the position- and that I HAVEN'T USED TO WORK IN THE INDUSTRY EVER-!

How fucking stupid do you have to be; how fucking deplorable, and fitly and rotten do you have to be-?!

The anger I feel when typing all of this out burns so fucking hot in my chest; I feel like I could scream for the rest of my life; until my throat was ripped, and raw- and I still would not be able to give the rage and hatred and bile enough of a voice.

They don't even pay you enough to live off of. Why the fuck would I want to stay on £300 a month, when that barely covers fucking food unless you're tactical, and scrimp, and save every last fucking penny.

Yes, work coach, there *is* something I'm not telling you. It's that every fucking job I have ever worked; freelance or contract, makes me want to kill myself. The idea, the reality, of waking up every morning in the cold; tired, to march to an office, or drive to a warehouse- to spend 8, 9, 10 hours every day of my life, for the rest of my life- slaving away on useless, mind-numbing, unimportant tasks- makes me want to kill myself. I was able to last *two months* before my mind melted and I nearly fucking committed; after so many fucking years of just hoping and praying something would finally kill me, or I would have the fucking guts to kill myself, all it took was *two months* as a wage-slave for my brain to decide it was time!

The thought *alone* makes me so fucking sick that I don't want to live, the reality I just *can't handle*. I haven't self-harmed in years now, and I still don't feel the urge. Instead I feel like a scared, trapped rat pressed against the corner of my enclosure; my heart beating a million miles a second as I wait for an invisible predator to gore me.

We get *so little* time on this Earth to just *live,* and you're telling me I have to spend *two-thirds* of it *earning my right to stay alive?!* FUCK THAT-! There's not enough wonders in this WORLD let alone this UNIVERSE to warrant that kind of deal. I have *seen* what this fucking world has to offer, and I am not impressed. You have taken the actual, legitimate miracle that is life, and twisted it into something *not worth experiencing*. I've seen everything I wanna see. I want off this fucking ride already.

I live in *filth* surrounded by *filth*, where I am forced to reckon with the fact that I very soon will be forced to stay with whatever job I next get, or else my fucking family won't be able to afford to live. That's not fucking fair!

For context, my partner is moving over to the UK by the end of the year, and because the UK is a shit-hole, we'll both need to work in order to afford rent. I've been living at home since I became unemployed; my mum being good for legitimately this one thing and nothing else- which is a whole other can of worms that I want to choke me to death. But soon, I will need to get a job- but I know I can't *handle* getting a job, and it feels like I can *see the guillotine dangling above my neck!*

I just want to create; I just want to exist; I just want to be able to eat, and sleep and be warm, and create- and that's it! Why the fuck do I have to *work* to earn my right to be *alive.*

Also, ha! 'I just need to get a job', as if I haven't taken the first fucking thing I've been able too every god-damn-time it's arrived. You wanna know why the only two places I've worked after the Dojo were at a warehouse, and a psychic hotline? Because they're the only fucking places that said YES!

There is something so fundamentally *wrong* with me and I don't know what it is; I sleep and eat at my desk in my chair; I live surrounded by trashbags because somehow the bins are *always* full- and my mother and brother never actually clean the fucking house (I always clean my area, I just don't take the bags out sometimes for a few weeks); I fantasize constantly about such *fucked up things* that I don't even want to mention because they're that bad; I've just been desensitized to them; I go through trackable phases where I just *can't sleep* no matter how tired I get and it completely fucks up my ability to retain time; the only friends I have live in another country and I might not get to live with them for *five more years*\-!

My ability to spell and read has also been significantly degrading too for the past several years. Sometimes, I'll be typing and I'll just spell a completely different word? Or press the key to a completely different letter- or spell basic fucking words wrong and not know how to spell them. That seems... less important compared to everything else, but it's something that's been upsetting me.

I feel like the few friends I do have are constantly one bad interaction away from leaving me, even when I know for certain they never will- to the point where it sends me into fits of manic depression whenever one of them doesn't respond to a message I send them- which just makes me feel worse because- why the fuck am I like this?

The point of this post was supposed to be me complaining about not being able to tolerate being employed, but it kind of devolved towards the end so I'm probably just going to mark this as a vent. 

I am being serious though when I ask what's wrong with me. If you're, like, a medical professional or something- I ask you to try and point me in the direction of *anything* that would explain why I'm like this because I just want to know. That's it at the end of the day. If I can put a name to what is wrong with me, I think it'd make me feel more secure in knowing I'm not just a pathetic, idiotic loser who can't handle life.

MentalHealthSupport,"So, when I was around 17 I assaulted my cousin… I’ve hated myself ever sense, for 2 whole years i stopped caring what happened because if I died naturally, my mother wouldn’t have to know or realized I died without being able to help me, I chose to drink every weekend and do illegal substances. I wanted to die especially since that wasn’t the only time I didn’t that. The more I realized what I had done the more I hoped someone would just take me out but that never came. I got married to my amazing husband but even then I was planning to let myself pass with covid but before that happened my husband made me feel like I wasn’t that person, so I kept living, I got in contact with my cousin and apologized. I explained I was trying to fight the feeling that was pushing me towards that action and my mind just turned off, it felt like I wasn’t there and my body was on autopilot. I’ve realized since then it came from the isolation I’ve dealt with and the thought that the only thing I could provide for someone else was sexual in nature. I’m not trying to excuse myself, I know I’ve done what I shouldn’t, I won’t ever be like the hero’s I’ve use to look up to, but i like to think that I’m not the same person as I once was. I’m 27 now and realized just about all my sexual experiences were bad and that has left such a deep scar that I’m not sure if I’m trans or not because of how much disgust I have for myself. I also haven’t been able to do anything with my spouse lately because anything of the sexual nature sickens me. Most recently I’ve started to feel disgusted towards myself again, I don’t know what I should do, I want to be there for my spouse but I know without healing that wound I don’t know if I can make him the happiest he can be, but I feel like I shouldn’t move on because I’m the one who did those things, I’m the one who fucked up and mentally scarred my cousin.

I opened up to my mum about it (first time telling anyone i was struggling) and she was fine in the moment like i felt relieved and it was great. But about a week or so later she saw me not studying or something and said something along the lines of “dont come crying to me when… (idk)” but what stuck was her saying dont come crying to me after my most vulnerable moment and that lowkey fucked me up a bit because i was at the lowest time in my life when i talked to her, and she used it against me. 

I think this might be where my problems with expressing emotion stems from because i always have this fear if i ever want to talk to someone telling me that my problems are invalid, or that im troubling them with my emotions, or that they might use it against me (these 3 are the main ones that come to mind)

I’m tired of it all and I feel so lonely, I sleep to try to not let my mind wander into overthinking and it feels so suffocating because I just want to talk to someone who can show me compassion for what I’m going through. I’ve always been the one to be there for others but when it comes to me I’m shoved to the side and left to deal with my emotions by myself.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello all, 

I wanted some advice on how to deal with a difficult situation at work. I have a younger colleague whom I'm currently struggling to work with. We're both engineers but I'm more on the project management side and she's a developer. I noticed whenever our conversations get technical and I ask her some questions in areas that are not clear for me, for example : ""hey, I am not sure I understood what you meant here in the document, what does x and y mean?"" 
She responds always in a very defensive, confrontational and condescending tone.

This in turn makes me feel very anxious, scared, my heart beats very fast my hands shake and I'm unable to think. I just want to cry in that moment out of fear. 
I want to make her aware of this but I'm concerned she'll gaslight me and make me the problem and make my life more difficult.

The issue is she and I have been talking to eachother about the struggles in the company and she complains about the company everyday to me and she's resigning in 6 months. But it's exhausting her constant complaining. 
I'm afraid to open up to her because she might also say I don't have evidence of this behavior or she might spread rumors about me to her support coworkers and might hurt my job. She cannot be trusted as she's crazy.

During my 21 years of living, I do have problems but I never once experienced being depressed about it, I smile and I know I can get through with it.

For the last 3 months, I’ve been this very sensitive and emotional motherfucker, I cry all the time for god knows what. I’m damn sad all the time it’s stressing me out, I don’t know why. I figured my stressors would be my school but it really isn’t because my academics are doing well, I have a mom who listens to me yap. In all honesty, I’m well aware that I’m lucky to have a support system, but I don’t know where this sadness came from i’ve been like this for 3 months already, I’m becoming toxic to my bf.

MentalHealthSupport,"Good Morning, 

I guess I am here just looking for support from others that struggle. I have been OCD since I was in 8th grade. I have also had anxiety most of my life. I have had two really rough bouts of depression, one when my son was born and the one I am in now. Just to make a long story short, it all started about 2.5 years ago when I switched job. I was a principal at a middle school and I decided to move to my districts alternative school. I knew it was bad, but I had confidence that I could change it. When I got there it was really rough. I immediately did not like it but I was stuck. While I was there my first year my sister in law took her own life and then a close friend of mine did the same. At the end of the year my son went off to college and I was not prepared for that either. I started to really get down. I have been getting help since it all started. I ended up stepping down from the principal job back to an assistant principal which I did not want to do, but I didn't have a choice. When I have experienced depression it would come and go, now it seems like its here to stay and I get so exhausted dealing with it. I know tons of people deal with it, but it just feels like Im alone. I talk to my wife and mom and I feel like it is wearing them down. I just do not want to deal with this forever. I am on medicine and doing all I know to work to get better. I just feel stuck in this cycle of ups and downs. Primarily downs. Any suggestions or encouragement is welcome.

MentalHealthSupport,"TW: Depression/ Suicidal Ideation

I don’t know how to start this, so I’ll cut to the chase. I’ve been struggling with major depression for over 5 years. I feel little identity within myself, and I find that I struggle to make any decisions regarding my own happiness.

I only do things when other people need me to do them. I feel no drive to do anything out of my own volition because, simply put, I don’t know what I want. I used to love drawing, anime, singing, listening to music, hanging out with animals, etc. But now, every time I look at those things, I feel no more interest in them. 

I’ve been struggling with this on and off for over five years, and almost any direct call to my family asking for help has been met with distain. While some family members were initially supportive, later becoming burnt out and unresponsive (which I think is fair, because I would probably feel the same way) others like my dad and uncle claim that I am either “doing it for attention” or that the depression in question no longer exists. My father even went as far to call my antidepressant “poison”. The thing that hurts the most has been hearing from my closest friends, “I’m sorry, but I don’t know how to help”.

I feel absolutely at a loss for what to do. I feel like I’ve done what I’m supposed to. I’ve talked to my family and friends about it, I’ve sought treatment, and I’ve tried about four different medications to help alleviate symptoms. I was even hospitalized as a result of this suicidal ideation. 

Please, even if it’s just little things, what helps you get by? How do you feel motivation? Why is it even worth getting out of bed? I figure that if I just start off with the little things, maybe I can pick myself up.

MentalHealthSupport,"kinda pathetic that my goodbye is on Reddit isn’t it? well I didn’t write out any letters or send any messages so I guess I wanted to have some sort of last goodbye.

I’m sitting in my car right now, I just bought sleeping pills, and it’s sunny and hot outside. I had never thought of it before but as soon as the thought came to me last night, I knew it was doable. Because instead of a decision to kick the chair out from underneath myself or a decision to deeply cut myself, both of which will have immediate intense pain resulting from the decision, I instead get the easy decision to peacefully swallow a pill, lay here until i am asleep, and then probably will be uncomfortable/sweat/seize later on, but the hope is that I will be too sleepy to be fully present in the pain.

And I can’t go back on it.

I also only have an hour left before this plan could be ruined, which means I need to take the pill right now or else my parents will get suspicious of why I’m sitting in a parking lot when I’m supposed to go home. 

I’m in the very back of a massive parking lot, surrounded by empty spots, directly in the sun.

I actually have sports practice in 2 hours which is also why I need to take the pill asap (as soon as I’m done typing this post) because I don’t need to be discovered before it works because failed attempts (from what I’ve read) are worse than being dead. 

Anyway, I tried really hard to fix my problems, but after 7 years I’ve come to accept that it’s genuinely just something fundamentally wrong with myself. No matter how hard I try, it will never make a difference. I have quite literally tried everything I possibly can. 

Unfortunately I didn’t have much time to find a good place to park, because where I am at, many cars will drive past me and potentially see and report me, which will ruin the plan completely.  And if somehow it doesn’t work, not because of someone reporting me, then I probably can’t drive home either because of the sleepiness. Or maybe I can. Idk.

MentalHealthSupport,"I’m a 21-year-old male studying mechanical engineering, and I’m writing this because I need help. I’ve been struggling with something dark for years, and I’m desperate for guidance. I want to share my story in the hope that someone can offer me a way out.

As a child, I was curious about many things, like animals, machines, and cars. However, by the age of 8, my curiosity shifted toward death and decay—what you might call morbid curiosity. I became obsessed with animal anatomy, and this escalated when I started watching documentaries about animals hunting and feeding off others. I remember being intrigued by dead birds and getting close to them, much to my parents’ concern.

This dark interest grew worse as I got older. At 12, I kept a dog’s mandible bone for over three years, and I killed a kitten and a toad. These acts didn’t disturb me, and I would often pick up dead fish from my tank and poke them. At 16, I got my first smartphone and access to the internet, which led me to violent movies and real-life gore, including execution videos. I didn’t feel disturbed by these videos; instead, I found them enjoyable, though I can’t fully explain why. This obsession continued into my teens, and I even started drawing violent and gory pictures of myself torturing people, including people I knew.

I began visiting a butcher shop early in the mornings to watch the butcher kill hens. He would warn me not to watch because it might affect my ability to eat meat, but I couldn’t stop going. I even wanted to do it myself, but I’ve always held back due to society’s rules.

I grew up in an upper-middle-class family with loving, supportive parents. My parents are educated and happily married. I’ve never experienced abuse, and I had a stable childhood. I excelled academically, was socially skilled, and was known for my confidence and public speaking ability. Despite my stable upbringing, my dark interests have seriously impacted my life. I’m scared that my obsession might lead to necrophilia or something worse, and I don’t know how to stop it.

These interests have affected my academic performance, and I feel emotionally numb. I don’t care if people leave my life, even those I’m close to. I’ve never mourned anyone’s death, not even my grandfather’s. I’ve accepted death as inevitable, but I can’t feel the grief that others do. I don’t know how to empathize or console people, and it’s hurting my relationships. I’ve been ready to end friendships easily and never felt bad when people left my life. This worries me, and I know it’s not normal.

I need help to get rid of this obsession. I want to feel normal, to have empathy and compassion like others do. I’m tired of pretending to fit in. I’m afraid that if I don’t get help, my facade will eventually crack, and everything will fall apart. I don’t want to be a freak. I just want to feel what normal people feel.

I’m reaching out because I don’t know who else to turn to. If anyone can help, I would be so grateful. I want to stop being consumed by these dark desires and find a way to be more like the people around me.

MentalHealthSupport,"Bare with me, this is probably a strange thing to describe but something I've been dealing with for a very long time and I'd like some advice on it. 

I am very excited talking about my own interests, but as soon as someone I'm in a conversation with does the same and it's something I don't particularly care about, I suddenly feel an extreme annoyance and borderline anger and want to move on to something that has to do with more of my interests. I don't know how to say it but I really don't do this on purpose, in fact it makes me feel horrible when this happens.

I love my friends, and I always hear people say that if you truly love someone you will support and love their likes and interests no matter what because you love the person, so I feel like I'm a horrible person incapable of love for feeling the way I do. 

I obviously don't tell my anyone to stop talking or tell them I don't care, I would never ever say that to someone. I try to encourage them to keep talking in spite of how I feel but they often notice I grow disinterested/annoyed and want to move on to talk about things I like and make them feel bad. I do genuinely put in an effort to suppress my reaction because I know it's unreasonable, but I'm bad at hiding my emotions.

I feel horrible when people get annoyed/disinterested at me for talking about my interests, so I feel like a selfish hypocrite for reacting the way I do.

I really don't want to get annoyed and I want to support my friends and their interests. I feel horrible that I get so disinterested because I know it'd make anyone feel like I don't care about them and only about myself.
I won't say that that's not the case because it definitely is, the way I react is selfish and cruel, but I don't know how to stop it.

Years of trauma , young adolescent homelessness , worked myself through college and dx with MDD & anxiety at some point , then Bipolar, and now PDD x Borderline . 

I never really got a break in life to care for my mental health properly. Was always in survival mode but did what I could building a tool kit to keep my mental above water just enough to get through the next crisis. 

Life started to calm and get a little more stable (housing &started work) but even with going to therapy twice a week for 2 hours each session I still struggled tremendously. Eventually my therapist talked me into going inpatient, taking leave from work and now I’m doing intensive outpatient M-F 4 hours per day which is a lot of emotional labor but has been helpful enough to get me out of this spiraling despair I was in. 

I’m due to go back to work in May but I don’t think I’ll be ready even with accommodations at work and concurrent intensive treatment. I think I need to work on my mental health and address my trauma without worrying about work. I can’t do both. And I think I’ll need way more than just a few weeks. Maybe years 

The issue is: 

I support myself . There’s no family or friends to fall back on financially (not even emotionally really either).

She loved me so dearly and I rejected her glances, her beautiful smiles and her kind looks. Her love that overwhelmed my heart and my mind. How far I have fallen, I never had confidence. I was 17 5’8 and I weighed 217lbs, I had to change to survive, I was on the verge of giving up and I lacked any confidence, I still do. I grew up sheltered, my mom could never afford to take us out but she tried her best, she always tried to take us out. I grew up in a home in the Florida suburbs where everything is far and we couldn’t really do much, my parents got the house after the market crash and my dad was jumping job to job, my parents noticed I was different when I was little. They used to hit me a lot until my mom I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 7. My mom tried her best to help me but I never did well in school and after my sister was hospitalized when I was 12 I never really recovered. I got fat, I became more socially awkward and I never had female interaction. When i was finishing my senior year I decided to make a change, I lost weight and changed my appearance, but I was still the same person. I did everything alone, I ate alone, I slept alone, I went to prom alone, I rotted alone. As soon as I turned 18 I enlisted in the Marine Corps and I met Eme. Everything was going for me, we started dating and eventually we both left for boot camp. Boot camp was tougher for me since I was in a “toxic” company. It was much more difficult mentally and physically, I thought the Marine Corps would make me a man, that it will complete me and change me but I’m still the same kid I was prior to joining. My SDI told me I was a man but I was still a kid in his eyes, he said we were all his little brothers in his eyes and that we were all kids. He is a great man, he is my idol but I can’t even keep up. My DI said once “before a Marine I am a Man”, I can’t help but think to myself and ask what am I?. I don’t know what I am. I’m still that fat kid who cried alone at night, that same kid who had no friends. I don’t know what I am. I’m nothing, Ronald Regan once said “Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in this world. The Marines don't have that problem”, but I read that and think what a lie that is. What is my purpose? I have none, my mother keeps me going. I’m still a kid, but I’m a also a Marine a Rifleman, before a Marine what am I, what do I have. I have nothing. I am nothing, I’m worthless, there are so many people who wish they had the chance I got and they would give everything just to be in my shoes. In MCT I got strep, my fever soared Andy throat was closing, I asked a SSGT for the corpsman and I collapsed. I went into shock in the back of JLTV speeding towards a ambulance and I couldn’t help but close my eyes, I felt so cold, my left eye was going dark, I saw dark spots slowly grow and the corpsman kept sternum rubbing me and telling me to stay awake, stay awake kid. Even then I was a kid, all I could think about was my mom. The Lt colonel came to visit me in the hospital and I asked him if my mom was notified that I was there and he said not yet and if I wanted to call her, I told him no, I couldn’t let her know I was weak and I failed. He said it wasn’t my fault but I still asked him to not tell my mom. I could only cry for my mom in silence under a blanket, I was so cold. I was a kid all over again. My dear Eme always took care of me, even in sickness she was there, she left me on a Friday afternoon, “your too immature, you promised to change and you haven’t”, “your still a kid”. I can’t help but think what if I kept my eyes closed, what if he looked away for just a second and let me submit into the cold dark peace. I have come to realize she was my everything. I’m sorry for not appreciating you. My friends told me to go on dating apps and I tried but I was too scared to talk to new people. My friends say I have everything going for me, women have told me I’m attractive, I’m 18, 5’10, in Great shape and I hold a great title. But in the inside I’m still a kid although I have the body of a man and went through trails and tribulations that men have failed in. What am I, our 2nd Lt tells us after every PT that we are worthy and we are loved, that we must seek and show love, joy, peace and patience. It’s like God sent an angel to tell me to not give up. What am I?. I’m just another body for the Corps, just another number, I don’t see myself growing up, my sister said I’m growing up that’s it. But what is my purpose. I lose all my friends. I’m desperate for help and I do everything in silence, with sadness and pain. I’m so young and I have accomplished something that only 1% have but what is my purpose. I robbed someone of an opportunity. Someone else deserved this, not me, I earned it but at what cost, I lost myself even further after it. She left and in her leaving she took my only chance of happiness. I love her from a distance, it pains me but I still love her. I’m sorry Eme I didn’t mean to hurt you. I told her I hope you find a man who will treat you as you deserve, not someone who doesn’t even know themselves, I hope they treat you better than I ever could. I Hope he does all the things I should have done. I told you they always leave but it isn’t your fault, I understood that from the day I met you to the day we split, you don’t need to remember me, just forget that I ever really was, truly I tell you I was a memory born to be forgotten. A grain of sand in the mighty ocean that is your life. Forget me I tell you, I hope I didn’t leave a sour taste in your mouth. I know I don’t know you guys but I’m lost please help me, don’t abandon me please I really need help.",I can’t help but lose everyone and it’s killing me,1743045391.0,1jkulsz
MentalHealthSupport,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can, but I want to make sure to give enough context. My brother (43M) was diagnosed with biopolar disorder in his late teens, and after a very rough several years, he really improved in his late 20s and had been largely stable without medication. He and I live several states away, but we've kept in regular contact, especially the last 3 years.

About 22 months ago (summer 2023), he experienced a traumatic event that I now believe may have triggered the beginning of psychosis. He started talking about very dark and concerning things he ""remembered"" from childhood that at the time I couldn't say with certainty were false, but seemed very unlikely to be true. I may have interrupted an attempt at him taking his own life a few weeks after. A few months after that (Oct 2023) he and I did a long camping trip together and had a very nice time, and he had seemed to be back to normal.

Last summer (June 2024) there was another triggering event that made him lash out at my father and cut off communication, which was very sad, but it wasn't the first time he'd gone no-contact because they have a difficult relationship. I've had to be careful since then to avoid the topic because my brother was very angry and blames my dad for difficulties in his own life (which is partially true).

Over the last several weeks, he's been under increasing amounts of stress due to his job contract nearing an end and not having any success finding another opportunity. He believes it's because of my dad that he will lose his job and hasn't been able to find another one (required background checks and some legal trouble my dad got into a long time ago, but my brother has had his own legal troubles as well). He is the sole breadwinner because his partner does not currently work (although he could), and they have a large number of pets to care for. 

A few days ago, we were texting back and forth about lighthearted things and he seemed okay until the conversation started to veer into negative territory. I made a clumsy attempt at changing the subject, and in doing so managed to deeply offend him when saying something that under any normal circumstances would have been easily recognized as a joke. He sent me a picture of a gift I'd gotten him decades prior broken on the floor and told me he didn't know if he wanted to talk to me anymore. I texted his partner to tell him I was concerned about my brother's mental health and asked him to lock up their guns.

The next morning, my brother sent an extremely long email ranting about why he couldn't forgive me and listing out multiple detailed false memories in which myself and both my parents had either emotionally or physically abused him over the years. He referred to himself as an orphan and said he wanted nothing to do with us anymore. I again texted his partner to express grave concern, asked him to look after my brother, and let him know that he can reach out to me if he needs anything. I emailed my brother to apologize for offending him, to explain that I never meant to give the impression I had, and to tell him that I loved him no matter what, but would respect if he needed to take a break. (I did not attempt to refute the false memories because I knew it would not be well-received.)

I messaged my mom to let her know what was going on and suggested she try and continue casually texting with him, but to be prepared in case he decided to push her away as well. To both our surprise, he has continued to respond to her as though nothing is wrong, which gave me hope. But last night, he responded to my email by re-iterating how awful our family is and saying that he would only consider speaking to me again if he managed to keep his job. If his job contract ends with no prospects, he is planning on ending things and had instructed his partner to send prepared letters to each of myself and my parents only after his funeral had passed.

I don't know what to do. Part of me thinks he's so far gone that there's nothing to be done except wait for that awful letter in the mail, and part of me thinks I'm giving up too easily and I need to try and fight to change his mind. But what would I even say? He has no idea that he's so unwell, and seems to believe I'm one of his many tormentors. His partner is timid and passive, and I can't rely on him to intervene. I can't force him to see a psychiatrist or take medication, and would it even help after going untreated for so long? I love him dearly, but I can't see any path that doesn't end with either that letter or a text from his partner confirming the worst. :'(","Is there any coming back from untreated long-term psychosis, and if so, how to help someone who doesn't want it?",1743051706.0,1jkwenj

It was ""unfair"" to her and I understand that but it felt like I was dying. They stayed the night anyway, and the next day she said that about my medication. It really hurts.

MentalHealthSupport,"I (F32) have had a pretty up and down relationship with my mom majority of my life. It's always been hard for me to predict ""which mom"" I'm going to get. When she's great, she's great. But when she's not, she's really not. This would quickly turn into several novels if I fully went into our lore. But the main point is that she's inconsistent. And as a result, so is our relationship. 

About a week and a half ago I moved into my own apartment. After having been back living with her for quite a while. Due to a number of life circumstances. She helped me move in and unpacked majority of my stuff for me. Because it's all just been so emotionally taxing on me. I had no energy to do it myself (again, a novel's worth of an explanation to give the full picture of why I am so beyond burnt out). She stayed with me for the first 4 or 5 days. To continue helping me set my place up, get more things I needed (she spent over $600 just on things i still needed around my place 😳), and to just be there for emotional support. As change to my norm is not something I handle well. I wouldn't say the first night here alone was a complete breeze. But it didn't take too much longer for me to completely lean in to having my first bit of true alone time in a very very long time. 

What confuses me and I cannot make heads or tails of (this is far from being the first time this has happened) - is how I can go from NEEDING her around me at all times for days... to suddenly feeling like I want nothing to do with her. This time being especially confusing as she's been alarmingly comforting/supportive during the last couple weeks. Yet I somehow slipped into one of these... phases where even relieving a simple txt from her irritates me. Everything bothers me. Yet, simultaneously, on a subconscious level I feel so guilty for feeling that way. Because she has been SO good lately. Had she been awful to me then, sure, of course I wouldn't want to hear from her. Or be around her. And I can never seem to predict when these ""phases"" will happen. Or when they will end.

I went through an assessment a few months ago. Because I felt there were a great deal of things I was experiencing that didn't fit under the umbrella of what I was already diagnosed with. I already knew I have depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety. I was shocked to come out of that assessment with... the same diagnoses. No bipolar, no borderline personality disorder.. just depression and a lot of anxiety. However, this assessment unfortunately did not cover developmental issues such as autism and ADHD. Both of which I highly suspected that I have. 

So I don't know.. I don't know what this is, and I certainly don't know how to manage it. And I can't keep living with the guilt of how I imagine it must make my mom feel. And of course, it's not even something I can try to explain to her. Not just cause I don't even understand it myself.

MentalHealthSupport,"#TRIGGER WARNING! Bad case of panic attack!






I've been out for a bit shopping. I was already trying to calm me down from anxiety.

Backstory:

A few months ago my body went full Parkinson mode from taking Lithium and quitting it too fast. I ended up in the neurology ward of our hospital where I underwent a CT, Lumbar Punction and MRI and they found nothing neurological. But still gave me Levodopa. Which I am still taking. The symptoms vanished and I am at my physical normal. Which really is nice.

But lately I have breathing issues. For example I wake up gasping for air and/or having to force my body to breathe again. That scares me. Do I probably have sleep apnea? But sometimes it even feels as if my body is just too lazy and then I have to breathe manually.

I am about to see a lung specialist.

My doctor said that the dose of the Levodopa seems to high. Also it's listed in the side effects that it can have an effect on breathing. I should talk to a neurology doctor. Great. I almost immediately got a panic attack then. They managed to calm me down.

Since then I am just more scared. Sometimes I am just chilling and starting to feel dizzy and have to take a DEEP breath. It's as if I just stopped breathing without noticing. Just now I had it again while I was typing this out.

Fast forward to this afternoon:

I wanted to go shopping. Look for summer clothes. When I was at home I already felt weird. Tried to shake it off and stay calm. But then I was in the shop. I walked around growing more and more concerned. Thinking of asking the staff if I can sit down somewhere. But instead I went outside. Wanted to sit down on a bench. As soon as I started to walk I felt dizzy. I thought I will pass out. I thought if I do in public people would steal my stuff so I decided to go into a Café and order a water.

Inside I stopped and thought of asking for help. I looked at the staff helplessly while turning off my headphones. They didn't notice at all that I was highly unwell. I looked for a table and went there. Sat down. Felt bad. Anxiety rising.

A server came up to me and asked if I am okay. I just told him I think I am having a panic attack. He asked if I want water and I nodded. He brought it. I couldn't move my fingers anymore. I asked for a straw. He brought one. I asked him to stay with me. He did. Tried to calm me down and said he knows how that is.

That's when it happened. My whole body except my eye area and the back of my head started tingling like mad. My hands and fingers cramped and stiffened and I couldn't move them at all anymore. My lung started tingling. I was scared I would die. I couldn't breathe. I got loud. Other guests looked at me. Told me to breathe calmly. Asked if we need water. The server said we have it already. Thanked them.

I couldn't move my face anymore. I barely could talk. It was so scary.

When I finally calmed down I apologized to the guests and they assured me it was okay. One even offered to order a tea but I politely declined saying I had my water and that's enough. I thanked her.

When that attack started the server called an ambulance. I asked him if they were finally there. Until I saw them.

They brought me to the hospital where I am right now waiting for a psych doc. They drew blood from me thrice to look at my oxygen level. Thrice because the first two times they accidentally drew from my vein instead of artery. They checked my blood pressure and my oxygen level with this test thingy you get put on your finger.

I don't know if I have to stay the night. I don't know how I come back home. Thankfully our town is pretty walkable tho. So if I have to I can walk back to my bicycle and then go home.

But I am scared. Scared that it will happen again and that there is nobody to stay with me even tho I have housemates. Scared that I will pass out or worse.

I've had panic attacks since childhood but they have never been like this. I screamed when I had them and I thought I was dying. But I never cramped. Ever. Until a few months ago. I was so scared. And today was the first time it was THAT bad. I couldn't even really move my arms anymore.

When I was in the hospital and finally could move again my arms had a bad tremor. I was scared I would have that permanently now but it's gone now. My fingers still tingle but I am breathing normal (I think).

I hope the doctor can help me. At least for now.",I had the baddest panic attack in my adult life and now am scared it will happen again...,1742927034.0,1jjqcel

MentalHealthSupport,"So I (19F) was trying to schedule an evaluation today for ADHD and my mom and tia have been saying I just need to call and do it myself since I’m an adult and it’s not that hard. So I did and the lady on the phone started asking if I have a provider who can I get a referral from, though it’s not necessary because I can self refer and I started getting confused because idk these terms.

I was wondering if I needed a referral like would it make it faster or easier. Is your provider your primary care doctor or the clinic you go to or healthcare plan your apart of? I tried asking my mom who’s literally a therapist and she was just like “if you don’t know what you’re doing then look it up because I don’t know”.

MentalHealthSupport,"**NOTE:THIS POST IS MOSTLY FOR VENTING PURPOSES, BUT ANY QUESTION,  ADVICE, ENCOURAGEMENT, OR MAYBE EVEN FURTHER DISCUSSION IS WELCOME**

Let me start off by saying that I've never visited a professional for the matters I want to talk about , these are just my personal feelings and experiences in my small life.

That being said, I believe that I've gone through a severe phase of being depressed throughout some of my teenage years(more specifically from around 13 to almost 17). Since then, every now and again, I'll fall into what I think could be called depressive episodes. What I mean by that, and what's my experience with them? Well, mostly I put my bad thoughts in a box in the back of my head and try not to touch it. Well sometimes, things happen, or I see something that pushes that box back to the surface and opens it. These episodes used to be longer and going on for maybe a month or three (yes, three). Nowadays, being older, wiser, but well, with more responsibilities, I manage to keep these episodes to only one night, or maybe three to four days at most. What are those like? I'm glad you asked.



These episodes are like a self hating, self loathing back and fourth between me and my brain. Do I hear voices? No, I'm not schizophrenic. But I do hate myself and think how much of a fucking failure I am.

""Oh no, don't say things like that, you're not a failure"" As much as I'd like to be able to say that to myself, when I look at the facts, my oh my, does my self-loathing go on steroid mode.

I'm in my mid twenties, still in uni, living with my parents, no job, no driving, no relationship, no money, no independence. What else do I consider to be wrong with me? Well, despite of being healthy, I'm fat(like 15kg more than my normal weight), I'm balding, my teeth are crooked, my joints hurt, I'm addicted to various versions of pornography, and I'm not sure I can feel 'love' of any kind. Can I recognize it when I see it? Yes. But do I feel loved if and when that sentiment is thrown at me? Absolutely not, and that's probably the reason I don't love myself either.



More specifically, I believe that I'm so much of a disgrace and dead weight, that I actually don't even deserve to be loved. I can not, for God's sake, what the very few people I hold close (namely, my family and some very few friends), see in me. Be it calling me fun, interesting, caring, loving, capable, worthy, put anything you want in there, I don't know how they see it in me. I'm in such disbelief, that I can't fathom the idea of someone finding me useful as a person to have in their life, I feel like I don't have anything to give someone. And that's one of the reasons that I actively have stayed away from relationships, well, even situationships for that matter.



That being said, I've had one semi serious relationship, lasted a couple months and some like 2 very short flings way after that. And I'll use them as examples on how my brain tricks me into thinking the way it does at this point.

The girl I was in a relationship with we started out very casually, I couldn't fathom a serious relationship, she wanted the same(in the start at least). She was also my first in terms of sexual experiences. That's in my early twenties, she was 18. Way more experienced than me. About two months in, she asks me the cliche ""what are we"", proposed an official relationship, I accepted.

Now did I like this girl? A bunch, which was weird in and of itself cause like, I didn't have romantic feelings for anyone for years before that. And honestly, it wasn't that bad. At first at least. After about a month she was just....there. She wasn't trying, she wasn't present, always had something going on. Meanwhile I always made time through my schedule to go out and meet her, even if for a couple minutes, always walked her home and then took the after-night bus for an hour back to my place. Never once did I feel like she really wants me, or really wants to be in this relationship. Eventually she saw the obvious herself, that it wasn't going anywhere and broke up with me, with her being the one crying because she didn't want to really break up and really liked me, but it just wasn't working (I still don't understand????)

Well honestly, it didn't hurt at first, I was feeling kind of numb. Until I was outside of anyone's view, late at night walking to the bus stop, where I broke down weeping. Why? Well because, my whole life I've felt like I'm on the background, the second choice, the not so important one, and no matter how much I tried to make things work with her, no matter what I did, I still wasn't good enough, and honestly I've been telling that to myself for like 10 years now, it's been kinda ingrained in my brain.



Anyways, that ship sailed, we went our separate ways, I was feeling like shit for a few weeks, but not really depressed, but still hated myself for not being good enough. Come along two years later, a very short fling with a girl that never gave me a real chance because she still wanted her ex at heart (despite saying otherwise multiple times when I brought it up), and about half a year later, with another girl which after going on a date, she went ahead and threw herself to the first guy that flirted with her at a party the very next night.

That was a year ago, and I haven't even bothered flirting, asking out, not even having bunter with no purpose. Why's that. Because I know, that chances are, I might get rejected, or put on the sideline, or I can't make things work out. And even though I know that's part of the journey, it happens in life and doesn't mean anything, the moment I am alone at night, in my bed, I'll start thinking about it. How it didn't work out. And why would it? Nothing does. Nothing I do works out, most of the time I know damn well it's my fault. Not talking to people, not trying hard enough in uni, not saving up money, not working out, not doing anything to better myself in general.

I just drown myself and my thoughts in watching movies, or porn, or playing video games.

I have nothing I'm passionate about, I have nothing I can say I love, I have nothing I can say I achieved, I am nothing. I'm the result of actions (or lack therof) and decisions, and all it sums up is to zero, and not only do I hate, loath my existence for it. I hate myself even more that I do not have neither the balls neither the discipline to change my ways and do better, do something to become a better person, to succeed in something, to try and do something so that I don't hate myself so damn much.



This is one of those days. Where I curl up in my bed, staring at a wall, thinking that I'm a failure, I'm unlovable, I have no purpose, I have no use, and I'm so much of a lost cause that I can't even make a step towards bettering myself. In all honesty, I'm not sure what I'm doing with my life, and where this path I'm on is going to lead.





P.S. Let it be known that I'm I haven't been nor am I suicidal. I believe it's mostly because the idea of death and just ""not existing"" scares the living shit out of me. But my point stands.

MentalHealthSupport,"I'm 21, I have anxiety and OCD. I asked a girl out, we went on two dates. The dates went well. We were acquaintances beforehand. She said she was down to see each other again and offered to give me a hug at the end of the second date. The texting is what is driving me nuts. The two dates were right before spring break. She was only responding after 6 hours and at one point I asked her if she was free Sunday and only responded after two days and said ""Hey! I'm not free Sunday but I am later this week"" and I said ""Sounds good, let me know what day works for you."" 

It's been three days since I sent that and I haven't gotten any response. It's about to be that ""later in the week"" type thing. It's driving me insane. I know I'm young I know there are plenty of fish in the sea. I haven't asked someone out in almost two years and I fell inlove with an idea of a relationship with her because I am obsessive and I overthink. Other girls I have tried to have relationships where it didn't work was because I overwhelmed them for constant reassurance; and this is the one time I tried my absolute best to practice patience and give her space. My mental health has definitely been a cause of failed relationships and this is the one time I think I've done everything right. 

I can't access her thoughts, I don't want to double text, I want to give her space, and all these thoughts are stupid but I cannot control my emotions. 

I tried every coping mechanism I can but I don't have many close friends to distract myself from it and when I do my hobbies I think about her.

MentalHealthSupport,"For context, I work in Hospitality Sales as a coordinator and work with many managers. A few of the managers I work with are a piece of shit and tend to be rude, petty, and snitch. 

I'll admit I have been dropping the ball lately and have not been on top of my game. It's been busy and I have been mentally and physically exhausted from the work load. I've been making mistakes here and there but finding it difficult doing it all.

One manager I work with, we will name as ""Warren"" as of lately has been sending emails to me with my own manager (We will call them ""Wanda"") copied on the email so Wanda is aware Warren's stuff takes priority and is being assigned to me. 

Today, Warren has been nothing but a petty jerk. Basically it was a trainwreck of a day. Started my day with seeing an email from Warren that said ""Why is that there are no reservations for this group?"" Not checking the name of the group, and assuming. One look and I already knew that Warren was not the manager managing the group, but they must've read the first word of the name of the group and assumed it belonged to them. Due to me being over the BS, I email back petty, and pointed out their mistake. 

Afternoon rolls around and more shit arises cause of COURSE the day can't get any worse. WRONG. At this point, I'm pissed and ready to get up and leave. I'm making changes to reservations for a client and respond to their email. They realize I missed a few of the changes and decides to call Warren to talk to them about it. Warren then sent a long winded email with Wanda copied cause Warren is an asshole telling me what was wrong and saying I need to be more thorough when reviewing before sending stuff out. 

Let me put it this way, the client only highlighted the stuff they needed modified, but DID NOT flag what they wanted removed. They decided to remove it from their spreadsheet and not let me know. NO way in hell am I going to take extra time to go through line by line and match it with what I have on my system to see what they no longer need if they did not flag it on the excel sheet.

I have not been this mentally drained in so long. Luckily I am actively in therapy and taking care of myself when I can but wow is this job so taxing at times. I just needed to vent as my entire day was horrible and consisted of one bad thing after the other. I have my 1:1 with my manager Wanda and I know they will bring all of the mishaps from this week up.

MentalHealthSupport,I had a pretty normal but some minor inconvenience made me as my dad put it “wig out”. Basically I got frustrated and panicky and started to cry(I do have some past trauma that I’m trying to work through but we haven’t seen a therapist yet) when I stopped crying I was still upset just forcing myself not to trying to numb myself until i was alone I like I did when I was going through my trauma. So I took a shower to make myself feel better but because I’m a over thinker all I could think about was what was wrong with me and all the bad things I’ve done in the past and hysterically crying trying to be quiet and the only thing that helped was sitting on my bathroom floor breathing into a piece of toilet paper. But now I’m sitting here (feeling much better now) confused on how and why that worked I’m not seeking medical advice just want to know if anyone knows why that worked encase I need it again(btw I have no clue why I was crying so hysterically/freaking out but it happens a lot so I want to know how to deal with it).,What just happened?,1742959481.0,1jk2k1p
MentalHealthSupport,"Hi everyone, (I've never actually posted before, so sorry if it's bad or really long, but that's probably just me and my overthinking... *please* don't be too harsh in the comments if you *do* choose to say something) and you can call me Keys.

So, many things in my life are not going so well (and by many I mean probably too many to explain in one post, and by not so well, I mean ***TERRIBLY***), and I just don't know what to do. Surviving like this somehow for **so** long has been hard enough, and getting through spring break **ALMOST** broke me. But I **still** showed up for school. I knew my friends and the people in my very special group would need me, and that they'd be very upset if they found out something bad happened to me. And all of us in this certain group at school (I **really** want to say what it is, but if I do, I will out myself and people from my school will know that this is **definitely** me, so I won't...)

In elementary school, I knew I wouldn't last, and I only imagined some dream of a future that would *never* exist. Yet somehow, I managed to stay then, and throughout middle school, *and* years of high school too (more than one). And every holiday, break, weekend, or even almost every single period of time when I'm not with the people I care about, I am ***devastated***. My household doesn't treat me well at **all** emotionally, other adults in authority have *never* helped (but I hope things change this time, since I went to the super-unhelpful school staff about it, and they have ""*legal responsibilities*"" and all that), and high school academics are **so** stressful.

To keep this as short as possible and leave me some time to work on other things, I *will* say:

I need some supports in school, because not ever getting any (and only being yelled at by teachers too for years, though currently all my teachers are lovely <3) has ***GLITTERALLY*** been killing me, from mentally, to grade-wise (though I am *not* failing for some reason), and also physically (too many things going on there too). My parents let me get tested for things but denied the start of the getting-me-help process last school year, and us ""minors"" can't do anything to help ourselves without ""*parental consent*"", and the staff dropped the case on me and they would have to start again **next** year, which is too late, and I'm doomed...

I am not allowed to go to therapy (for a lot of reasons, of course), and the last several people I saw were not very helpful at all. They knew about the abuse and mistreatment, yet **STILL** chose to keep on ignoring it (since it wasn't physical anymore), and they kept only *acting* nice and not so outwardly mean so people wouldn't suspect anything. I've **been** needing to get help for a really long time, but at *least* I have supportive friends now, otherwise I'd be long gone... And my parents think ""shoving meds down \[my\] throat"" will miraculously ""*fix*"" me, but I **know** (and they better, too) that's not how it works, **and** when they tried to do that to me years ago, they **saw** it not work with ***their own eyes***.

**And**, on top of these, which are only **some** of the main issues I can think of currently, I am not allowed to see my best friend who used to be my best neighbor buddy anymore. My parents say it's ""all \[my\] fault for telling the school who reported them to \[a certain supposedly-minor-protecting agency\] who called my friend's parents and now they will never let them see such a *bad influence* like \[me\] ever again, \[I'm\] **so** disgusting"" and a bunch of blamey and gaslighty things like that. They **always** speak *SO* rudely of me to other people **and** straight to me too. And if not that, they yell across the HUGE and awfully empty expensive house to my sibling (and I'm physically closer half the time) until I break from all the unnecessary loudness and unshush myself and *TRY* telling them to go over to *her* and yell all they want, but then I get caught in the crossfire anyway, and it gets worse and my constant stream of passive self-naughty and soupyslidey thoughts gets worse and to stop myself from going through with the latter without a fully-fledged plan (and distract myself from finishing that plan), I... sometimes do the former, and by sometimes I mean it's been getting even more terrible and much more frequent too and I **really** don't want it and all my healths to get any worse and I *know* I should go and get help but it's not working, oh, *and*...

My phone, which isn't the most conventional kind (and saying what it is will out me, again, since I'm pobably the only one for MILES around with a phone like mine, and it's obvious too, since I *love* to take pictures with it a lot), has stopped working for almost a month. On the first of this month, I was at an event, and I took a lot of pictures, and my phone storage said it was almost full for a few months before that, and now it's all my fault for not listening and making it crash with all my photo-taking and now I must suffer the consequences. But, since I got a new battery recently, at least the logo shows up on the screen again (but now it won't turn off just like it did that fateful day so the new battery needs to come out too), but I'm really worried that I won't get to see my media like my photos (obviously by now), chats, notes, recordings, contacts, and all those things again... and that's ***REALLY*** been upsetting for me.

And I can't talk to my household about getting gender-affirming care, and my dysphoria is killing me too. They've known and I've been out for **so** many years, yet they don't give a *fluff* about it, no matter how I try to explain (and the last therapist sort of explained a little, but not thoroughly enough, which wasn't good either...), they *still* refuse to budge, and waiting for the ""law"" to release me isn't okay, since I won't be able to do suddenly do everything all by myself the day after I'm completely restricted from doing **any** independent things at all (I mean after the courts declare me over 18).

**Finally**, yesterday, after knowing what my parents said about not seeing my bestie ever again, and living in a *super*\-lonely isolated suburban neighborhood and not talking to my sibling for nearly a year due to *reasons*, my best buddy at the school I attend didn't show up to our special group thing yesterday morning, which worried me, since we didn't see each other over spring break either, and they weren't at school all day yesterday, so I emailed them and found out that they wouldn't be at school **or** in our group for a while, and they only said ""a while"" to comfort me probably, but I ***know*** it will be a really long time, since today our group members had to fill in for their part and make do somehow. It is ***so*** depressing, and the people who have heard what happened and probably got more information than what my friend told me, said (to each other) that they couldn't talk about the details, and most of our shared friend group has no idea and just think they're absent... it ***truly*** broke my heart yesterday, and it keeps shattering into more and more tiny pieces indefinitely. I feel like it was my fault for venting excessively and bringing their mental health down too, even though I was reassured by them multiple times that doing so (asking for advice and complaining and reaching out for help I mean) was okay. And we are really good at hiding things like our feelings and such, because of the nature of our group, and that isn't helping us either. 

But even though all this (*AND* more) is happening, and will happen and get **worse** since we're nearing the end of the school year, I KNOW I have to continue trying to stay strong and positive, if not for myself, then for *all* the rest of us. Because losing *one* person temporarily (hopefully) is bad enough, and we can't have another being gone permanently, and besides, this isn't my year to end it. I WILL try to stay and experience majorhood like I thought my fantasy someday-self might, and **then** decide. So I will do my ***absolute*** best to keep my fragile eggshell of a self together, even if I crack and ooze out all my sides.

Thank you so much for reading, and I hope this long message (and the future advice I hope it gets) helps someone in the future, even if my own story fails. Also, I *will* be borrowing my other friend's phone to text hotlines again like I did between classes today (and maybe even call if I'm brave enough to speak aloud), to get advice from those experienced adults too, since the web chats have **never** helped or worked fast enough (they even said once that they were out of ideas and my situation is hopeless! who says that?! **I** may be exhausted, but *they* can't be just giving up!).

Take care of yourselves if you are able, and try not to be too naughty, because the people who care *are* looking out for you. 👀

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi all, I’ve never posted on Reddit before or asked for online advice but I figured I’d give it a go. For most of my life I’ve had waves of obsessive (not implying I have OCD, just in nature) spirals of negative thoughts, either falling into the category of “I am a bad person” or “This cannot be changed.” If that doesn’t make much sense- I either hyper-fixate on things I’ve done or qualities I used to have, things I can rationally understand are part of childhood and growing up, but I try to convince myself I am in some way tainted as a human being because of them. Or, I hyper focus on something, usually about a romantic partner, once in a while a friend, that I cannot change about them. I am usually able to do this in silence and not let this specific thought process impact my relationships, but the depression and anxiety brought on from my internal spirals usually effects the relationship in some form. The hard part is I have rational breaks from my thoughts when I feel “normal,” and less hyperfixated, and I feel relieved and then panicked about how I acted, was perceived, or if others were able to tell the amount of distress I felt on the inside. But usually those are short lived breaks. I don’t know if this makes sense to anyone, or if they’ve experienced something similar. I have a great therapist and am currently trying to figure out medications, and have been trying to do a lot to take care of myself and my mental health.

MentalHealthSupport,"CW: drug mention, self-harm mention

I (M30) live with my friend (M27) and his ex-partner (NB27). When they started dating, it was just him and I, but then the partner moved in shortly after the beginning of the relationship. It became clear that it was soon fraught with fighting, arguing of an indeterminate nature, but I didn't do or say anything in favor of just letting them conclude the relationship whenever it got to be too much. I was, at this point, unaware of the specific mental health status of the partner (who we will call A).

As it happens, after a particularly nasty episode, A came storming down the stairs and yelled at me as an evident continuation of the prior argument, and said ""and you're a f*cking psychopath, don't even TRY to play dumb"".

What followed was a tirade that I can only describe as a psychotic break, accusing me and him of abusing A, manipulating them, teaming up, lying, god knows what else, saying how dare you do this to a mentally ill, suicidal person. The roommate (call him K) came downstairs to try calming things down, and A tearfully asked if he was going to kill them.

It was at that point I said, out loud, ""K, we need to call emergency services or something"", and A blew up and begged and pleaded and chastised me for saying that and K additionally discouraged me doing that as well (albeit calmer). So I didn't.

I asked K later for context, and he told me A has BPD and has outbursts like this frequently, and has a paranoid belief that K and me have been secretly hooking up during their whole relationship. We haven't, ever.

As things stand, A and K are both unemployed, K owns the house and gets unemployment but A doesn't have any support structures apart from a friend or two, and if A is kicked out, they will be homeless. They have both discussed medication and therapy, but for the aforementioned financial reasons, this has yet to take place. A is also a ketamine user and smokes tons of weed every day.

I live in the state of Washington. Are there any affordable ways that A can be cared for or supported that don't involve just continually living here and undergoing cycles of psychosis and paranoia? This is not a sustainable situation. I have preexisting plans to move in with my girlfriend soon, but until then, this is where I live. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated ❤️",Advice for BPD Roommate In Crisis,1742858422.0,1jj56om
MentalHealthSupport,"I will consider myself a pretty balanced healthy person, but the last few years I’ve noticed a really strange phenomenon in my stress levels. What will happen is I’ll be perfectly normal and then some stressor occurs and my body immediately goes into fight or flight. The problem is it stays in flight for days sometimes weeks at a time. what happens is , it’s like a surge of hormones or something . I get overwhelmed and THEN I start to get what I think is Neuro inflammation. I get brain fog , head pressure , over thinking , balance problems . I become anti social . My eyes become big and flinchy . my walking becomes different. (Like a puppet on strings) Every fiber in my body becomes a different person. I feel like normal people who are in fight and fight usually go back to baseline when the threat is over, but in my case, it stays ,lingers and manifests in various ways. Something is little as sudden eye contact from a stranger, can set me into weeks of hell and mental torture . The brain pressure, zaps , electric pressurey feeling is what inebriates me. Often times I refrain from doing anything social until it goes away and like I said sometimes it takes three or four weeks to go away . It’s super depressing . What is this ? I’m only 33.

I have been doing some meditation and it works for like 25 minutes before the feeling of stress starts setting in again. This really isnt a good feeling and i don’t know how to help myself as good.

MentalHealthSupport,"I've been feeling bad for a few weeks now. I've had depression and anxiety since I was 12. I'm autistic and I've been an undiagnosed anorexic for almost 4 years now. It's usually manageable I'm 21 I know how to deal with things and I'm on meds that help calm the worst parts down. It hasn't been that bad not like it was before I got on meds but I still don't feel like myself and usually I can wait it out but this time I can't. 

I don't leave my room except for school and work on the weekends. I don't have the mental energy to do anything not even watch a YouTube video about something that normally I'd be into. I still watch things but it's old stuff that I'd watch back in hs before things got more difficult. I still like them they bring me comfort but I think it's weird I can't focus on the new stuff that I know normal me would be interested in that I like my usual documentary and drama channels but I just don't have the brain space for it I guess. 

I feel numb alot. I can't focus on my schoolwork which since I'm in the last 6 weeks of the semester is something I'm really freaking out over. Luckily my English class is in person and it's more of an if you show up you pass thing also English is an easy grade for me despite the trouble I have with my professor nothing bad he just in his words dosent do computers so most of our work in class is worksheets and we only submit our essays online because it's required I think and he takes forever to get them back. 

Last one I turned my paper in the day after it was released about 2 weeks early because he changed the deadline the next day because he messed something up. He waited till the day the paper was due to tell me I had messed something up and had to redo it. You can imagine how stressed I was. Thank god my girlfriend helped me with the rewrite cuz idk how I could have done it myself in one day. It's been 2 weeks btw and I still haven't gotten it back. I finally asked him about it today he said he forgot about it but he should have it graded in a week or two. Today's class we were supposed to be researching for our last essay of the semester before our final exam but he forgot to double check with the librarian so we did not do that today. Was kinda disappointed cuz that's one of my favorite things about writing and I picked an interesting topic for my essay. Instead we just spent the class period doing a practice quiz for our exam which I'm pretty sure I failed. 

I just can't do anything right my focus is bad things go in one ear out the other. Even when I should know the answer it's literally right in front of me I just can't get it and it's so frustrating I want to cry. I missed a few of the online zoom meetings for my french online class. They're not mandatory but we have to show up at least 7 times before the semester. I haven't been to one all month and I still have 3 more left to do. 

My history class is also online. It's the most simple class I have but also the most difficult. It's always just reading the textbook and regurgitating it back on a paper. It's very time consuming and I've had to learn with this class how to manage time and do an hour or two of work on the paper for a few days because you can't write an entire chapter overview in one afternoon like you can with most other assignments. So for my history last weeks assignment didn't get done. I had the questions written out I tried to read the textbook answer was literally right in front of me but it just didn't stick in one ear out the other. I know I can do it compared to a whole chapter overview a few questions even if they're essay style should be easy but I just couldn't. I feel bad it was due yesterday at midnight but I just couldn't do it. Idk what's wrong with me my grades can't afford to slip not now not when I'm so close to finishing the semester. 

I usually can just wait episodes like this out but I can't do that now I have responsibilities and stuff. I've had thoughts of suicide alot lately. I haven't attempted anything but last week I kinda ended up locking myself in my room scared to death cuz I was so close to doing something. It was a really tough night texted a hotline twice but idk if they really helped. Last night at work I felt so close again it took over if I wasn't at work I would have slashed my arm up bad. I ate a burger there at work got freaked out cuz of the calories and it just spiraled from there. My girlfriend managed to talk me down later when I was almost done with work so when I got home I didn't do anything but I know I was close literally if I wasn't at work I'd be having to wear long sleeves for weeks till the cuts healed.

Idk what to do anymore. I don't want to do anything but I have to be myself again. I don't want to let normal me down. I don't want my girlfriend to worry about me so much she's the best thing in my life and I want to be better for her. I tried taking weed the day after my first suicidal episode. I don't do it often my parents are really strict and I'm scared of my mom but I'm at home alone alot when I don't have school or work so I was free to do it. I didn't take too much just enough to calm me down and it did help. I was calm and happy almost for the rest of the day and part of the next day too but it didn't really last so now I know that whatever is going on isn't something as simple as I need to relax. 

I just want someone to listen and tell me what to do because I don't know and I don't think I want to experiment with drugs the last one my psychiatrist put me one turned me into someone else. I wasn't me like I was but there was something else taking over my body I wasn't acting or thinking right. I stopped taking them after 2 or 3 weeks. It was the most unsettling experience I've ever had with a drug and I don't ever want to go through that again. I'd rather be me but anxious and depressed than a pod person.

     And no, she hasn’t really done anything to make me believe it. If anything, I did. But, not while we were together. We’ve broken up before and I didn’t think we would get back together. I did something with someone. You can fill in the gaps. I told her what had happened, because she wanted to be with me. She broke up with me first, her mental health was bad, she was scared, and it was too much—that maybe I’m too much? I am too much, im aware. I know. I did what I did, when we broke up because before she said to me that she was happy without me. Mind you, this was only a couple days after we hadn’t spoken. We had spoken everyday for nearly 2 years, throughout the day. “For the first time in what feels like forever” happiness bullshit. So I told her something like “ok goodbye then”. Oh, I cried. I sobbed. It was the worst feeling ever. It was like grieving someone who was still alive. Grieving someone who you could see, could text, could call, and argue with. I remember exactly how I felt, exactly where I was. I was driving, looking at my phone. The way your heart drops to the bottom of your stomach, it almost feels like your lungs deflate for a second, it’s hard to breathe. Your chest hurts. But anyways, the person asked to hangout and I said yes. Sometime in the night, she started blowing my phone up.She regretted it . I think the worst thing is, I did what I did, after I knew how she felt. We got back together after 2 months, I told her no. She would regret being with me, it would mess with her. She insisted. I was right. It messes with her. Badly. I didn’t do it to be malicious. But truly, I thought we wouldn’t get back together even when I knew how she felt. Why? Because, we had issues before that, our own personal issues we needed to work on. In those 2 months, she did what she needed to do… to at least make some progress. (Trust me, it doesn’t happen overnight. I know) Before, she wouldn’t have even done THAT. We talk about our life all the time. The future, the kids, the dogs,the house with a lake, and pools. I love talking about it with her, I love seeing her, and imagining it with her. I want it so badly but what if she can never get over it. She says she wants it to. I know it’s not just what I did that bothers her, it’s how I am. I’m a lot and idk. I just, I’m scared. This seems childish and unnecessary. Probably, idiotic, to think I won’t lose her again, to think I could keep her after what I did. Her feelings are so valid, I tell her that. I care. She’s so patient with me. She listens to me.

MentalHealthSupport,"My cousin(Albert) is in a self induced drug psychosis he can’t seem to break. I am afraid he is too far gone. My cousin is only 30 yeas old and already he has scars our family, including my poor aunt (his mother) who lives alone, she is divorced and her eldest was murdered (wrong place, wrong time, wrong person). He only living son has become unstable.

Due to his recurring outbursts everyone is afraid of him. He is a very good pathological liar that he was who to keep his dad sending support even after him dropping out of school, not being able to hold down a job, and not being responsible enough to take care of all the necessary things require to have an RV as your living space.

Just recently we discovered he may be abusing amphetamines. We know in the past he suffered from depression and he was prescribed medication, but we fear he is using the hard stuff. My mother owns a house right next door to his moms house, and in the past times he visited his moms house, we have seen our security  cameras go off in the middle of the night, and he could be seen just pacing back and forth. My husband and I stayed at my mom’s house for Christmas 2 years ago and noticed erratic behavior: sudden urges to fix his home to become more private with a more blocked view on our end. He would also take off in his car for A few minutes, then come back. over the course of a day he left about 5-6 times for about 10-20 minutes. My sister has even noticed he hits some kind of pipe in his car but says it’s weed.
It took him dropping a glass pipe with a bubble on end at my families Xmas dinner( just this past) and my 17-18 year old nephew finding it for everyone to realize just the severity of this situation.

Our family would like to plan some sort of intervention but do not know where to start. Just a couple months ago my eldest cousin “Giovanni” was called upon by my aunt to help her with her son “Albert” when Giovanni got there, Albert went into a tangent about my aunt being a terrible mother and how she never held him as a child( don’t doubt it, she wasn’t the warmest mother from what I could see growing up with them) 
Albert said to Giovanni, “would you even hug me if I asked you to?”
To which Giovanni answered, “yes of course I would, you are my cousin and I care for you man. You are loved.”
To which Albert’s response was to lean in, but as he did he quickly tried to kiss him and grope Giovanni.
Giovanni quickly stepped back and rejected him as quickly as he could and also told him he needed to be institutionalized because Albert is clearly mentally sick.
Albert heard the word “institutionalized” and went missing for about a month.
I fear that it only does he feel lonely, he also may feel like an outcast for being gay. ( he may of been raised in a masochist environment, and may of been deprived of a motherly touch, so he looks for comfort in the gay PNP culture and artist living culture but I fear he is a predator to society. He is on a one way ticket to self destruct. Is he too far gone? He has so much hatred in his heart, it’s hard to talk to him.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello All,

As a preface, suggestions and help are appreciated, but I have been doing obsessive research on all of my mental health, so keep that in mind.  I (M39) will try to be as open as possible about myself inside and out as I go, but this account is also anonymous so I have to clip details when they get a little too personal.

TL;DR:  I thought I was making progress, only to have new setbacks and it has not quite exactly filled me with hope.  I haven't given up nor do I intend to on finding solutions and answers for myself, but damn, I feel like I got reset to square 1.

Okay, formalities out of the way, hey all.

So recently I was advised to do a neuropsych exam because I have been diagnosed with ADHD for about 10 years now and told my current therapist that I feel something else is at play.  Turns out, there was. While knowing this changes nothing if left untreated, and I can continue on as normal, I obviously want to correct my shortcomings.  Here is a short list, starting with diagnoses and then moving on into terms that may be mental health related but also may not be a thing in themselves.

-ADHD  

-Depression  

-Generalized Anxiety  

-PTSD (SA Victim+Bullying+Life)  

-Dissociative Amnesia (Its not terrible, but concerning for sure.)  

-Dissociation/Depersonalization  

-RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria)  

-PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance)  

-Autism Traits (PTSD is blocking the ability to diagnose/rule out autism.)  

-Alexithymia  

-Merinthophobia  

-(Claustrophobia?)  The above might be the true problem here, just recently found out there was a word for fear of being bound (tl;dr its the phyical state of being bound that panics me, not the idea of it.)  

-Acrophobia  

-Possible Borderline  

-Possible but unlikely Bipolar  

-Emotional Numbness  

-Executive Dysfunction, like this is the worst symptom I think I have.  0 Ability to prioritize.  

-Porn Addiction? (Look, it probably is, but if so, its just over the line so IDK?  I don't want to admit it to myself for some reason.  Will check porn in inappropriate places, but privately of course.)  

-Video Game Addiction? (This was bad, but has now stabilized, I guess.  Not sure if it was ever an addiction since I used to game like 60hr/wk and now its like 10 if I am lucky, but I also had nothing much else to do so back then, so is it an addiction if you choose to fill your free time with it?)  

-Very strong need for perfectionism at times  

-Very strong need to know the answer to a question if it suits me. (Will obsessively chase an answer for days even if its not worth it.)  

-Very strong rejection reaction when I get blindsided by perceived harsh or  incorrect criticism.  

I think that's it, just mainly typing the list out for myself so I have a reference point.  

Note#1: While I am going to talk about my relationship at times and it may not sound rosy, the relationship itself is not a thing that is a debate for me.  If you have helpful comments that build communication, I welcome them, but debate on if I should leave/stay is not welcomed.  Please just trust me that if you're thinking something, I have already analyzed many different aspects to our relationship and I choose to move forward knowing what I know.  Its very hard to sneak intentions past me.  

Note#2: I am open to DMs if you'd like to privately discuss anything mental health related at any time, if something in my post resonates with you.  Discussions only though, don't just DM me to ask a bunch of questions about myself or my symptoms.  I would rather  questions about my mental health issues be asked here so that maybe someone could benefit from the post one day.  

Note#3: This is intended to essentially be a journal of sorts as the act of writing all of this out is my therapy.  As such, I probably will update and edit it until I feel it has served its purpose.  

Now, lets get to why I am here, venting.  

So, I guess I could stop here and just go AHHHH LOOK ABOVE DO I NEED TO GO ON?  But, I won't do that today.  So, yeah lets get to current day then I guess walk it back as I go.  So, about a couple months ago, I got diagnosed with Dissociative Amnesia and PTSD with autism traits.  I had suspected something was fucking with my memory that wasn't just ADHD.  I started to wake up and realize that memory gaps in my life are not normal, and after some googling, I found some things that could cause what I have.  Walked in theorizing one of the aforementioned could be the culprit, WHOOPS, might be all 3.    

So here I am sitting with this new information, and no clue now where to go from here.  I felt that my management of ADHD was already a task, and now I gotta try to walk back habits and trauma minted 20-30 years ago.  This new information helped me and hurt me.  Now, I have some new information and with that comes the tools to treat said disorders, YAY!  Oh but wait, now I realize I know very little about treating these things and unlike ADHD, there isn't usually a little magic pill to help you along halfway.  Not to say you can't manage without medication, but I think it's safe to say it helps.  It was a sobering reality and I kinda just went into a depression shortly after the diagnosis.  After recovering from that, I really needed a new plan, which I am working with my therapist on.  

I think the most frustrating out thing out of all of these issues is it means that I am confused like half the time (trying not to be hyperbolic, might be less, but is significant.) as to where I am, what I am doing, what I was saying, really anything.  My ADHD or Amnesia frequently erases my immediate term memory and then my ADHD or Amnesia also erases weeks at a time of details when I get overwhelmed.  Its not total forgetfulness, and with the right reference, I can recall things.  But my mind will just go oh hey, logic took over for a while, you can be a human again out of nowhere, then I quickly realize that I have been depressed/stressed for a month.  I have vague memories of this timeframe, almost none of the details, but I get a good enough feeling that I existed and carried on as normal as I could during that period, so its not a concerning loss of memory, just...really annoying?  Often times my memory will cause interpersonal issues, as I will tell the same story 16 times to everyone I know, but possibly not even remember even one instance, for example.  That means me being told things is always subject to not making it to the hard drive in my head, and it happens more frequently when I don't want to do something.  


Moving on to another thing, the RSD and PDA.  These are also a couple of the worst, because the RSD makes me feel legitimately crazy sometimes and the PDA just defiantly flies in my face inhibiting my own plans and goals.  I have to fucking agree with my brain on tasks, otherwise it's the hardest thing in the world now to me.  It looks like I'm just being childish, but I can't understate how much mental effort it takes to overcome this feeling somtimes.  Imagine telling your brain no, then it just says ""fine, try doing your task without me,"" then proceeds to become a paperweight and I either get no thoughts or a mixture of my brain telling me what to do vs me trying to do affirmations to override the block, with limited success.  Then, I get RSD with myself because I don't want to let #1 down, so I get emotional and upset because I can't do something I should be able to.  If only I could show everyone what this dynamic is like in real life, because, almost all of the time, I get ""you're lazy, you're just trying to get out of work,"" or ""its not that big of a deal just do it.""  Internal me knows all of this, knows that it is my own mind holding me back, and it doesn't change anything.  I would love to have my chores done all the time, I even feel great from the satisfaction, but my brain seems to think work is for suckers.  

The last point I'll make for now is:  

Well hey at least I get benefits of my brain being ridiculously good at specific things due to some of these issues.  WISH I COULD JUST BE NORMAL AND DO WORK NOW   

PS:  RSD also is paralyzing me in social situations and makes me feel crazy for getting upset because I took something the wrong way.  

P.P.S: I want to also touch on the emotional numbness later.  

P.P.P.S:  I may get into it, but my S/O cannot help me with my journey at this time, so that's why I chose reddit to vent to.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi, sorry for my bad English, it's not my first language. I'm 19 and I go to university (it's my second year). I wasn't able to make friends, I literally know only one person in uni and when I'm there I feel so lonely.

I did not sleep at all last night and I over shared to my clinical instructor about my life via text about why I could not come in today, but I feel like I was more trying to justify needing a day off to myself than him…I just feel like everyone has these high expectations of me and I need to be pushing and doing at all times. My life consists of me going to clinical all day and then going to the gym and sleeping and on top of that we have no money because my boyfriend is also a PT student.

MentalHealthSupport,"So, it’s kind of a long story but I will try to be succinct. I have mental health issues (C-PTSD), and they were being exacerbated by the abusive environment I was in, greatly. At one point I reached out to a mental health crisis team in the area and I was given the option of a short term stay at a mental health respite place. I figured it was worth a shot, so I went. When I got there, there was only one employee and she was acting, in my opinion at least, very unprofessional, immature, and disinterested-and became pretty rude when I said as much. 

(The behaviors I noticed were her pretty much being annoyed when I even showed up because she had to get off her phone, and her absolute disinterest in the process of checking me in.)

I continue talking a bit of shit as I get amped up emotionally, she continues handling it really poorly for a supposed mental health professional. At a certain point she deemed me to be too belligerent and called the police-again, at no point was she professional or trying to work with me, she was just very dismissive and disinterested. As someone who’s been in mental health centers a handful of times, this just didn’t seem appropriate to me.

Anyway-the police arrive, and keep in mind, this was Texas…so, naturally they were douchebags. They didn’t listen to my side at all, kept telling me to stop talking. The woman’s boss showed up and was also talking down to me, trivializing/mocking the state of my mental health, and said that she worked at my then therapy clinic and basically threatened to tattle on me there. 
Then, the police tell me I have two options; stay there and shut up, or walk home alone. It was around midnight or 1 am, and I am a petite woman. That didn’t seem safe to me, I was about to suck it up and sleep until morning, and then the first woman’s superior revoked that option and said they “didn’t want me there.”

The police said, “You heard her. Grab your stuff and start walking home.”
I felt trapped and panicked and thought, I’m not going to risk getting assaulted (or worse) on the way home, I have to do something. Then I proceeded to punch the original staff member I had encountered in the face, so that I could spend the night in jail and not wandering around the streets of a city I had just moved to with a dead phone. I KNOW, it wasn’t the smartest move in retrospect-particularly not in front of two police. Obviously, I got arrested.

They were quite rough, despite me hitting her once and then laying myself down on the floor with my hands behind my back. I felt a knee digging into me, the handcuffs click firmly around my wrist-and then, 3 more clicks as I feel them squeeze my circulation off. They openly mocked me with their words.

When I arrived at the jail, I was still pretty upset, and panicking-it didn’t help that they put me in a creepy windowless concrete cell with an intercom to communicate with and a grate in the floor to piss in, complete with an actual dead rodent inside. Also, no bed. I used the intercom to notify them that I needed my epilepsy meds, which I had on my person when I was arrested. I was told that I was on detox (???) so I couldn’t have my medication. I told them I wasn’t arrested on drug or alcohol charges, but even if I were I’m pretty sure detox doesn’t include prescription medications. They ignored me, and when I didn’t drop it, they turned off my intercom-my only way of communicating with them if I *did* have a seizure.

In the morning, literally the second I could, I bailed out and I haven’t heard anything since, no court summons or anything like that. Apparently it’s still not on my record, either.

I can't feel emotions or empathy, I'm just empty all the time. I don't want to do anything at all either, and the only reason for that is that I don't see the point. I'm just going to die one day so why does what I do in the meantime matter? I know I hate my family, and I don't have any friends, not that it changes anything. I don't have anyone to turn to, I'm truly alone. When I look to the future, I don't see the point in it. Why bother when you'll die and then be forgotten one day? I'm hopeless, and I don't know what to do to change it. No matter what I do I don't feel, I don't love and I don't care. What's the point in life if living itself can be so cruel?

I don't know nor do I understand what I am supposed to do in life. I was always called a genius kid or an old soul. But because of this, I was never told how to try, I was always comfortable with being the way I was. So much so that I never tried to improve, and look where that got me. I don't even know if there's anything I can do to feel better. I go to a therapist and have been for the past year, but all that's got me is online schooling and that isn't even helping.

I've had suicidal thoughts and completely petrifying depression since my grandma passed and my girlfriend had been very supportive for me. She knew I was depressed but not suicidal. I eventually told her during an emotional breakdown where I just randomly started crying out of the blue and all she said was ""okay"". I thought in my hysterical state I was just receiving her comment wrong but it didn't sit right with me and it made me more upset but I tried to hide it the best I could.

But she still cares about me and wants to keep in contact with me because of the way I'm feeling.

I never really grew up with a good family or support around me to be honest but I use to try to be positive and insert myself with people when I was younger, Like i use to watch movies all the time and see the actors live out these great, cool and just perfect lives, people to love. I know it sound stupid but I always looked up to them and would think to myself that i'll get those things one day.

In my earlier school years I wasn't really the most normal kid, I had anger issues and trouble talking to people but yet I would be energetic and passionate around them and about things i liked, which never really got me far with friends. I use to always find myself in fights or getting bashed, I had a few genuine friends especially a trio of older kids  who I always had around me, best people I ever met.

I got to highschool and I figured the best way to get people get along with me was to shut up and be quiet and only speak up when it was a topic everyone knew, which crushed my energetic personality at school, I would and still do please people just for them to like me and not think im a loser or a nobody.

I went through relationships like it was nothing just looking for someone to know and be with but they were always short term.

I lost two of my friends at ages 14 and 16, both of which I still blame myself for not doing more, I keep trying to move on and do better because that's what everyone tells me they would want. One of them had a kid at 19 and made me the godfather once i turned 18 a few years later. I tried my best to step up do my best but I could never get over the guilt of his dad's passing and I neglected him for awhile but eventually circled back because i knew deep down that his dad would want me to make sure his kid got the world.

  
He was the coolest kid I knew and it felt good to be the parental figure I never had, once i was around the corner from 20, he was taken from leukaemia. It's been about 6 months since that day, and I don't know



I work a dead end warehouse job, I've lost what I made to be my family and the people I think are my friends don't even want to spend time together and moved onto other people and I've just been stuck in this fucking loop of just being tired. 

i just don't know anymore i hate that i cant be enough for anyone i hate that i dedicated my fucking life to trying to please everyone and waking up feeling like shit. I'm sorry for the rant, It just feels easier to say here than to someone in real life.\\ ",Rant,1742822005.0,1jiqcl6

MentalHealthSupport,"I am 17 years old — a boy trapped in a cycle of self-destruction.
I procrastinate, I watch porn, I vape, I carve my pain into my skin.
For five years, I have been nothing but a ghost.
Now, I have no friends.
Not one.
My family, lost in their own vices, drowns out my presence.
Often, I just want to disappear forever.

She is 18.
A girl with a heart too big for this world.
She calls herself a people pleaser.
Unfortunately she gives until there’s nothing left of her.
Life never made things easy.
People used her, betrayed her, left scars too deep to fade.
She’s lost good friends, suffered panic attacks that steal the air from her lungs.
She believes she doesn’t deserve food, doesn’t deserve care.
She cuts herself.
She has tried to die — more than once.

And yet, somehow, we found each other.

It started three months ago.

That night, I tried to end my life.
But morning came, and I was still here.
So I wrote.
Poured my pain into a Reddit post, hoping someone, anyone, would hear me.
No one did.

Until her.

She sent a message.
Told me she was sorry.
That I deserved more.
Gave me words I never knew I needed.
I thanked her, thinking that was the end of it.

But the next day, she asked if I had eaten.
If I had drunk enough water.
(At the time, I barely ate at all.)
I answered.
Then I answered again.
And again.
And again.

Soon, we spoke every day.
Hours passing like seconds.
We unraveled everything—our pasts, our fears, our dreams, the pieces of ourselves we never dared to show the world.
There was no judgment.
No shame.
Only understanding.

Weeks passed before we understood.

One evening, I bought flowers, took a picture, and told her she meant the world to me.
She was quiet at first.
Then, she told me she loved me.
A moment later, I said it back.
It felt so right.

We grew closer.
Every whispered „I love you,” every „I wish I could hold you”, every „I want to fall asleep beside you and wake up to your warmth” pulled us deeper into something neither of us had ever known.
For both of us it's the first relationship.

And then came desire.

The thought of her ignited something inside me.
A longing.
To touch.
Neither of us has ever known intimacy, but if we were together, we would.
Slowly. Gently. Desperately.
Not just for the act itself, but for the connection, the feeling of being real in each other’s arms.
She wants that.
I want that.
We developed passionate fantasies together.
She tells me she would give herself to me completely.
She says it over and over.

But the world is cruel.
We are over six thousand kilometers apart.
Don't speak the same language.
Our English is bad.
It leaves no room for calls, for video, for more than just words on a screen.
We are trapped in distance, in silence.
And it is unbearable.
I'm also scared of direct contact.
It's so complicated.

She loves me with every piece of herself.
I know that.
But I cannot let her cling to a shadow she will never touch.
And yet, she won’t let go.
„Anything for you.”

I am still that same lost boy, drowning in my own darkness.
I am immature.
I am not a good person.
Not even close.
And yet, I make her happy.
I don’t understand why, but I do.

I can’t even maintain a normal friendship.
How could I ever hold onto love?
All the dreams we share — I know they will never become reality.
And it crushes me.
It makes me want to scream.

I don’t want to lose her.
She is my first love.
My only love.
The deepest connection I have ever known.
But I feel us slipping.

If I walk away, I fear she won’t survive it.
And I cannot bear that weight.

But if we stay, this pain will only grow.
I know that, too.

What am I supposed to do?
What the hell am I supposed to do?

Hey everyone, 

I need some advice on what to do. I‘m a 21 yo trans woman in a trans lesbian relationship. My girlfriend (26) is the most wonderful and beautiful person I know. She is truly one of a kind.

Now, my gf is struggling with dysphoria a lot because she had a pretty rough „male puberty“.  She has some aspects of her face or her body that she is extremely insecure about. It also adds that her right side of her face is paralyzed, so she can‘t have an even smile and one eye is always a bit more open and she can‘t close that one really. She sees herself as ugly. I‘ll be honest, when I first met her, she looked „weird“ but I couldn’t care less! She is such a beautiful woman and I love her. I also never really cared about looks overall. Personality is so much more important to me!

Now, I‘m diagnosed with potential ROCD, BPD, have ADHD and high functioning autism. Someone really wanted to freaking nerf me. I‘m also extremely hypersensitive. Could be part of my bpd as far as I know, the potential diagnosis is still very fresh.

Now to my problem: In moments like these, where she‘s really dysphoric and hates her body overall (mind you we are both passing in public btw), I really feel her pain. So much it drags me down too. I currently feel like shit. In those moments she really needs to be alone and deal with it alone. I‘d be there for her for whatever she needed.

Now, that this draggs me down too, doesn’t help her. Like, at all. She doesn’t want me to feel bad. Of course I wanna help her and I will always be there for her but she says what she needs is alone time so I‘m giving her that.

But how do can I protect myself? How can I deal with my hypersensibility without becoming a non-empathic and cold person?

Thank you for reading ^^

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi. I've always struggled a little with my mental health, but at the moment it's so bad it's very overwhelming. I feel like a lot of issues and insecurities have piled up on me and I don't know where to start unravelling them. I have a few goals for what I need to work on, so if anybody could share what helps them I'd appreciate it.

For context I will add that I was diagnosed with epilepsy last year, and I was put on keppra, a medicine that made me incredibly depressed. I am coming off it now but it's a very slow process so I have minimum a month more of essentially chemical depression to go, and I've never been so close to ending things so I need ways to get through the next little while at least.

1. I have a strong fear of judgement and abandonment when it comes to friends. Friendships are extremely important to me but after years of being the boring smart friend I always assume the worst even with the best people. I need to learn some confidence in my authentic self and how to be more lenient with people while still not getting walked over (because I am a people pleaser).

2. I need little ways to make my busy tiring college days a bit brighter, and ways to appreciate what I have. When I get home I have to go to bed very early since I commute so much, so i have less time for my hobbies then I'd like. 

Some suggestions of journalling or CBT exercises that helped you with depression or anxiety would also be brilliant.

I suffer really bad with nostalgia depression. If you’re reading this you probably know what it is but for those who don’t… usually nostalgia is something nice and warm and “a trip down memory lane” but when I get it I feel awful, sad, useless, desperate to relive those days knowing that they are gone, and I feel this way from a few hours to sometimes a couple of days. It comes and goes in terms of how devastating it is but it’s always there sort of. When I hang out with my best mate, I spent so much time talking about our old college parties and feel terrible about it and sometimes (and this is the worst) I’ll create a group chat with all of our group from school / college and get ready to send them all a message). My life isn’t exactly bad now, in facts it’s pretty decent but I just feel awful about it. Im only 26 but I notice now that it starts effecting “in the now” moments; like I’ll be enjoying myself and think “I really need to enjoy this because I’ll look back at this moment in the future”. It’s hard to describe exactly. I guess I wanted to know how others deal with it? I don’t do therapy or anything like that and I’ve never been on medication for anything. Is there any good books or anything? What would you recommend because it’s really taking over me lately.

MentalHealthSupport,"My mental health is at its lowest due to me not having self control. I (18f) has always been insecure about my weight since I’ve been in 2nd grade. When I was in 2nd grade I gained a lot of weight over the summer due to my over eating. In that time my mom made it very known she didn’t like it. Making fun of me in front of my family, friends , and waitresses. Yelling at me for wanting McDonald’s like the rest of the kids in my family. Even one memory of her coming home drunk from a bar making me sit in the living room as she told me how pretty I would be if were skinny. And how many guys would want me. My way to cope with all of the stuff was eating more which sounds stupid. I was heavy until my 8th grade when I had my first crush on this boy. During that time, I only ate one thing a day that way I would lose weight and be skinny. Cuz in my head the only way anyone would want me if I was skinny. I lost the weight and my mom was so happy with me. I worked out everyday. Only at 500 to 100 cal for a long time. When I got into sophomore year I started eating normal cal and working out a lot. My mom and me were close and anytime someone was starting drama with me, her responds was always “ there just jelous on how u look” it sound stupid but I thrived for that. During my sophistry year I learned I had to go into surgery due smthing wrong with me. When I got outta my surgery they gave me these pills I had to take. One of the side effects was weight gain. So I took to pills and in my luck i ended up gain 20lb. It sucked cuz I wasn’t even allowed to work out anymore. I everything turned around my mom and I started fighting again. She tried to restricted my food like she once did it made me super sad for awhile. Now im in my senior year and idc what she has to say about it anymore.

The anxiety has progressed really bad now, I am unable to leave my house without getting terrible anxiety attacks. However they aren't normal anxiety attacks. It started to effect me physically about 4 years ago, Once my anxiety goes up I will instantly start to have diarrhea. Now I am unable to leave or do anything since I will always require a bathroom. I am not able to live a normal life with going out with my friends or now I learned even having a friend over causes the anxiety. My anxiety activates with anything that is not normal for me. Anything that is not living a shut in neet life gets my anxiety up and I have no clue why. I don't even know how or why all of this started but I can't figure out any ways to help.   
  
I have tried anxiety medication but non have seemed to help. I tried 2 different kinds but nothing ever fixed it. I know smoking weed or alcohol could fix how I feel temporarily but I refuse to do those things.

My mom has always been there for me, but we moved away from her ex bf who used to be super abu$ive and controlling. He used to keep me away from food and lock me away in my room, alarms and taking everything from me, my mom followed in his footsteps, agreeing with him, screwing the door to all my bedding and clothes away in a different room. When i tried to eat, i was punished. This was mostly during summers about 2016, maybe 2018, I don’t remember. I’m still young now and almost out of high school so it’s been a while. But my mom finally saw how bad she was and how bad her ex bf was so she left after he hit her for the last and final time with me and we were homeless for a little. We went back and grabbed our stuff and left, now I live right next to my boyfriends moms house and in an apartment, and my mom has a new boyfriend and I’m close to my school.

But ever since we moved here into this apartment, I have felt depressed, I’ve felt su!c!d@l, I almost checked myself into a mental hospital bc I felt so depressed. My mom is never home, she works at a train company so her jobs in the morning but she’s never home at night. She’s at her boyfriends or out drinking. I’ve been basically living on my own, I pay my own phone bill, I buy groceries every money most of the time and I clean the house. I’ve basically been a maid for my mom and I don’t feel like a daughter to her anymore and more like a Roommate. She’s been getting more aggressive and has been treating me like shit and her excuse it “I don’t have rights bc I’m still young and I can’t vote”, so I sit quietly. I make our food, I take the trash out, I make sure all the almost expired food in the fridge is eaten and she calls me a “brat, entitled” she says to me all the time “I wish I would have raised you sheltered so you weren’t so liberal.” I work about 20 hours a week to keep up with our apartment, I go to school and i try to study and learn and focus but yk 4 hours almost every night at my job and then 6 hours of sleep just to wake up at 5:30 am after going to bed at like 11;30 pm bc of work doesn’t help my grades. 

About me being su!c!d@l, I do SH and I take THC to help with the pain and I like I have a good relationship with my boyfriend but I SH when I’m overwhelmed/panicked it’s a bad bad habit. But it’s been getting better. Last night as I’m writing this, I didn’t eat anything really and I passed out after trying and thr0w!ng up my food and my boyfriend found me and tried to help me and I cried and cried about my stomach hurting, my mom, school, work. Today my thighs and arms and stomach still hurt, I cut my hair off a lot and my mom yelled at me but it’s better then yk hurting myself to much. But now I feel bad, like I wanna cry and sit in the warmth of my boyfriend, I almost just want to take a much of meds and wake up in a hospital, away from stress of school and work and home. Sometimes I don’t want to wake up, I want to just fall into a deep less sleep of nothing and maybe go onto another life. Crying as I write this but it’s true, my boyfriend is so good to me but I feel like I’m not enough for him and there’s so many other reasons why I’m fucked up and I want to die but also so many why I want to live. 

I just want to ask, should I do something about my mom? My dad doesn’t live in the US anymore and so I can’t go to him for living. 

I also want to ask, is there any good ways of getting help without a mental hospital or anyways I could help myself other then buying stuff/impulse buying or SH or anything from being su!c!d@l? 

One last thing, should I tell my boyfriend? He helps a lot and last time I got to stay at his dads for a day but that was a one time thing so idk.

MentalHealthSupport,"I don’t even really know where to start. So this may seem all over the place. I am divorced, 38 years old with four kids. I remarried and my now wife has a daughter, whose dad is not in the picture and I am in the process of adopting her. I have tried medication. I have tried therapy, but nothing seems to work. I struggle to get negative thoughts out of my head and I am always very pessimistic about everything. I have this unwavering feeling of guilt that I screwed up my kids’ lives by getting a divorce and not being there for them 100% of the time. I fought for four years to get 50% custody. In California, they see a dad trying to get custody as someone who does not want to pay child support and they make it very difficult to get any kind of custody if the other parent is adamant about not giving it to you.  I have struggled with depression as far back as I can remember. I was bullied in school for being “different” because I come from an immigrant family who did not have a lot of money and I was not the best looking and no girl was ever interested in me some of which made it a point to tell me I was ugly or gross. I was sexually abused as a child. I truly think the only reason I have not killed myself is because of my kids if I didn’t have them, I would have zero reason to live. I have a great job make almost 200,000 a year, but that does not fill the void and never will. My depression and anxiety will get the best of me and cause problems between my wife and I. I let everything get to me in my mind just goes down a rabbit hole. I struggle to speak with her because there is a lot she is not sympathetic about and financially it’s a little hard because she spends a lot of money and when I try to bring it up, it turns into a fight. On the surface I’m put together but inside I am an absolute mess and I don’t know what to do. I travel for work so I spend a lot of time in hotel rooms by myself and it absolutely sucks. I really want to find ways to just stimulate my mind and be happier. I really do just want to be happier, but I can’t ever get there.  When I am alone in my hotel rooms, I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I know all of this seems so selfish because I make good money. I have a beautiful family and a beautiful house.

All of the mental health professionals I've met insist on trying to make some friends, obviously we're doing the whole love yourself thing, which has helped, I do respect my body and emotions more, but it's not enough,I still don't really ""love"" myself, I keep thinking that is the goal I have to reach, but I have no drive for it, no motivation.

Lately there has been a bit of a drive, and Im feeling guilty about it, I feel like it not the proper ""motivation"" and will just lead to more disaster.

Like being motivated to stay alive to gamble more, something like that. A good intent but a bad motivation.

There's been a girl in class around my age and *I think* she has an interest in me, emphasis on think, because as a chronically lonely, virgin, it could just be my mind obsessing over someone who has just paid a bit of attention to me, like they would on anyone, and I'm just obsessing over it and being delusional. 

And I'm constantly thinking, if this is true, is it even possible? How could she be attracted to my fatass? I'm a total loser, and telling her about my mental illness would just weird her out wouldn't it? And other questions, like do I genuinely like her or is this just blind love?(reference to previous paragraph)

My mind keeps trying to find excuses to not attempt anything with her, I keep finding imperfections on her, I keep looking at myself in the mirror thinking ""no way..."" , I just obsess over everything, I even think we're not compatible at all, I think I'm just so weird and have such weird interests and humor that noone can ever like me, especially her

Or perhaps love truly is unconditional and I can lover her for who she is and vise versa, but I feel like I can't personally love unconditionally, I feel like an asshole, I also have a porn addiction so my standards have been demolished of what a woman has to look like, I feel sick

But perhaps, this could be the key to improving? This could be the motivation that finally gets me out of this mental health hellhole? Having someone to love?

MentalHealthSupport,"Need advice in helping a friend who's been struggling mentally.
A little background on him:   studying in 12th science suffering from low/negative self worth, regrets, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, self doubt, hopelessness, academic stress/pressure etc. (None of these conditions are officially diagnosed)

#An outline of what has caused his suicidal thoughts recently:
He took a decision a while ago and couldn't stick to it and is about to face/facing the consequences which has led to his suicidal thoughts. As for now, I've taken necessary steps to ensure his well being for the next 2-3 months but I don't know how to help him anymore besides professional help.
P.S: I've always tried my best to help him and never invalidated his feelings.

#The full story:
A couple of months ago he decided to skip his college (high school) mock exam as it would give him enough time to prepare for the final exam which actually mattered and he believed that he could ace it. His parents weren't supportive of his decision initially but came around later (he gave them his word that he'd ace the exam). During phase-1 of the final exam, we had to present something in front of our class for a subject. Now he had mentioned his social anxiety before but he never really seemed that socially anxious to me or to anyone else. But his social anxiety acted up which made him take the first step towards ending his life, fortunately he was kinda caught (not during the act) and we made some arrangement with our teacher that gave him an alternative to the presentation thingy.
During phase-2 of the exam (the written exam), he fucked up real bad. He forgot a lot of things he had studied, lost confidence in himself and what not. Now he says he'd either fail or barely pass the exam. He's afraid to tell his parents about the final exam. He's registered for an entrance exam scheduled for the next month and hasn't been able to start studying yet because of a little procrastination but mostly because of demotivation and he feels like absolute shit. He doesn't value himself as a person worthwhile of life anymore (this isn't new and basically he considers himself nothing but just a failur). So he believes that he's gonna fuck up in the entrance exam as well and even if he performs well, it'll be in vain as he's almost certain that he's gonna fail the final exam held last month (entrance exam score is dependent on the final exam score).

#My advice:
I've advised him to open up to his parents about everything because who knows maybe they might consult a psychologist. He's reluctant to seek professional help because he can't afford it on his own and doesn't want to involve his parents as he thinks they'll consider him to be weak for needing professional help.

#His options (acc. To him)
Now according to him he has two options (the latter being the best in his opinion):
1: Open upto his parents sooner or latter (because the discussion is inevitable as he will have to discuss with them ultimately when the results are out) and then take a drop year which involves pressure from literally everywhere: self+parents+family+the fact that he's wasted a year and failed once+expensive. 
2: End everything before the results are out. According to him, this is the best option as it is the ultimate solution to all of his problems.

Now honestly, I don't wanna lose a great friend like him.  Just a little information about him, he values mental health more than anyone else I know, but is still a little biased about professional help (a little orthodox mindset about professional help ig). Even I'm living with the burden of not having called his parents yet and told them everything which I think would make things worse or weird idk. I could call his parents and tell them everything even if it costs me our friendship because honestly it's way better than regretting having done nothing later.
As for taking a drop year, he's afraid of facing everything once again and is certain the he'll fail once again. He has a very pessimistic mindset and negative views about himself. And looking on the positive side, if he does make it even in a top institution, with or without a drop year, he's afraid of the things he'll have to face in future like socializing+communication+building confidence (he's very underconfident right now). 
P.S: he never really shows whatever he's going through. Always plays dumb or immature or happy/neutral. And he's never had a well/healthy relationship with his parents either so the fact that opening up to his parents is difficult is understandable.

Now my question for you guys is what should he do without feeling more crappy than he already is? Or what can I do for him to ease his sufferings?
Imo, the biggest challenge in front of him that could make things a little easier is opening upto his parents.",Need help in supporting a friend through mental health struggle,1742695344.0,1jhoq12

I have 1 friend irl and we aren't very close. My previous few friendships have ended bitterly, and I rarely leave the house due to my fear of being perceived at all.

MentalHealthSupport,"Does anyone else, when you feel really hopeless (not to be confused with just sadness but specifically hopeless), have the middle of their palms ache? For me it is moreso in the right hand. Recently it has been accompanied by a feeling of paralysis in the hands for me, like sleep paralysis. One time I couldn’t move at all, or at least my mind had convinced me that I couldn’t. I think it’s interesting because this always happens when my life feels immovable, something I did was fruitless (the best way I can explain is it is like the myth of Sisyphus) - and then my body literally becomes paralyzed, like I had been in whatever situation. Sometimes the pain shoots up from my palm to up inside my arm, though I shouldn’t call it pain because it is more of a weird ache or weakness. It’s weird because it’s shooting like pain, but is not actually hurting me.

MentalHealthSupport,"I've been living in a foreign country for 16 years now. I've been in the house I'm in now for 5 years. The past few months have been hell. After years of no issues, suddenly my landlord has issues with everything I do ... the same things I've done since I moved in... She is now trying to make me pay for repairs that are her responsibility (tiles on the balcony, wood frames on exterior windows) by saying that it's my fault -not the tropical sun and rain - that they need repairing. She expects me to pay for them. She told me that I am supposed to pay for the repairs when they were halfway done.... As in she said the tiles need replacing, I agreed, she sent a repairman, then once he finished half the work she goes 'oh ya, you're paying for this.' I contacted a lawyer and she says the best course of action is for me to GTFO asap. It is hard to rent a place here as a foreigner and there aren't a lot of places for rent to begin with. This has shot my anxiety up to 11. The lawyer wants me to avoid talking to the landlord (which is my first choice too) but the landlord keeps texting and each time my phone lights up my heart races and I start physically shaking. I just muted her number for now as I'm typing this because she just (it's 1130pm) another message asking to come over tomorrow so we can talk.... So her number's muted but now I'm super anxious wondering if she's sent anything else.  

So I'm trying to find a place as fast as possible, so far I have 1 option but it's horrible and super far from anything which would completely change how I live my day to day life but right now it's literally my only option. Then I'm also starting to pack and clean all my shit. And I'm teaching online every day. 

After I saw the place today I came back home and cried, like sobbing, shaking crying and I couldn't stop. I could not catch my breath. I messaged the 2 people who I know in town (another foreigner and my cleaning lady) to help me and they're both amazing and trying but both of them said 'don't stress, just stop thinking about it' and it's like that phrase made it worse. Like gee thanks, never thought of that before. I literally can't stop thinking about it, nothing is distracting me, I can't read, crochet, watch anything at all, eat, or sleep. I'm insanely overwhelmed, I need to start packing but I have no idea where to start. I'm on my own until Monday when my cleaning lady is coming to help me clean/pack and rental offices are open. So I'm stuck in a loop til Monday. 

My mom suggested going to a pharmacy and buying some kind of sleeping aid or a night time formula of something just so I can fall asleep but that would mean going out in public and at the moment that's not an option.

So ya, I'm an absolute mess, in a foreign country, stuck in limbo until at least monday. It's fucking great. ",Gee thanks! I never thought of just 'thinking of something else' when I'm stressed,1742707925.0,1jhs96u

MentalHealthSupport,"sorry if this is formatted poorly or dosent make sense, im not in the best state right now and im on a new medication that makes me feel weird and believe odd things and im still getting used to it (to clarify this is not from the medication, as my infatuation with him started much before i started the medication) I 15F have an extensive history of mental health issues and trauma that ranges back to elementary school so this isnt that horrifying to come to terms with. I've been into grunge music for a decent amount of time, almost 2 years, however it was mostly the band hole and occasionally a few other artists. I never really had an interest in nirvana because it was really annoying that whenever i brought up that i liked hole and courtney love, my parents and others alive to experience the grunge scene always started schizophrenicly rambling about how courtney love is a heartless monster that murdered kurt cobain. My only experience with nirvana back then was hearing smells like teen spirit on the radio which i never really liked. However a couple months ago i decided to see what all the hype was about. I started listening to his songs more and more which  lead to me consuming more media surrounding nirvana, interviews with the band, videos of live shows, clips of him, etc. it was all pretty normal fan behavior. Then i saw the pictures. i think this is really when everything culminated and went downhill. Im autistic and ive had debilitating depression and anxiety as long as i can remember, ive just learned to live with it. i have a slight drug problem. it all kinda started when a little while ago, i wont talk abt what i took bc of rules but i ended up throwing up most of it before it could absorb into my blood. I think i only really got like a third of the actual dosages i took. anyway, in my totally fucked up state, i somehow ended up on youtube on my phone (i dont remember much past this and throwing up) and i ended up on a video of the images of kurt cobain's body that were released by the police in 2016. it changed me. this isnt the first time ive seen death, the images dont even show anything past his shoes and his hand and ive seen much more disturbing images and videos. but this sat with me. after i woke up and somehow collected myself the next morning i went back to the video. i cant stop watching it. i cant look away. this lead me down a rabbit hole into his suicide. i obsessively read his suicide note, look at the images, look at evidence, listen to the last song he played where he talks about shooting himself, watched interviews with courtney after his death, watched clips of him, wrote him letters. we are so similar, he talked about how nobody ever understood him and the world saw him as something he wasnt, i feel the exact same way. he talks about how he feels hes too sensitive like i do. we both use drugs to escape, i could go on and on about everything we have in common and everything amazing about him. hes like everything i am and everything i wish i could be at the same time. my entire life ive felt othered by everybody and its the first time ive ever seen anybody who feels the same way i do. i delusionally think that im the only one who understands him or that he can hear or see me somehow. i know this is silly and its not real. **i dont get any type of pleasure or satisfaction from watching this, i dont relish in his suffering and i really hope it dosent come across this way** whenever i go back to his music or the note or the pictures its extremely upsetting for me and i get extremely depressed, but i keep going back. i think i want some sort of comfort or closure or answer from these things that i never get. instead i always leave with the same lingering conclusion: **if somebody so similar to me, yet so beloved, someone that brought so much light to the world and so many people like me, someone that seemed like he had everybody rooting for him, still cant win, still suffer so much he cant bare to keep going, whats the point of me trying at all..? he was so great, so good and so beautiful inside and out. im nothing like him in that way. why should i even try? whats the point of staying alive.** im probably not going to kill myself. i never knew him but it feels like i do, i disgust myself. i grieve someone that never knew me. yet i feel like he can see me and i can see him. beyond death. no he dosent talk to me im not that fucking crazy. dont tell me im just immature and its some small crush on him, i dont even really like him that way, he was just so beautiful in every way like nobody ive ever seen before. im not some stupid kid that just sees someone they relate to for the first time. its so much more than that. i see him like nobody else did. im aware this is unhealthy and its not normal and its not the first time ive had delusions about things, when i was younger i thought the government had cameras in my computer and in my smoke detector. i used to hallucinate fairly frequently but it has mostly subsided for about a year. ive been hospitalized for it, i literally had to be at the absolute brink and go completely off the handle, ignoring school and my physical needs for it and still nobody took me seriously. i literally had screaming fits when i was in middle school where i just cried and cried and screamed and screamed if anybody got close to my room because i thought they were trying to hurt me. my parents handled this horribly and thought if they just screamed back that id be fixed. that worked as well as you could imagine. at the psych ward they told me it was anxiety and tried to give me some shitty ssris even though ive tried about every ssri and snri on the market and nothing has worked. i dont get them, maybe they think im a med seeker because i wasnt acting like an animal when i was in the hospital and around the doctors and nurses. anyway, kurt, i cant stop thinking about him, ive tried and tried, i stopped looking at the pictures and the note and listening to his music but i cant stop thinking about him. i dont know if im more obsessed with him or his death. i know its disgusting, but like i said i get no pleasure from thinking of his death. i think its a combination of some bizzare coping mechanism and desperately looking for closure and comfort. im not sure for what. that he didnt suffer? that hes not suffering anymore wherever he is in the afterlife? that it never happened? that its all fake and hes ok somewhere far away? that it really happened and its over? that if i do this i wont suffer anymore? maybe its everything. i cant grasp it, i never can. i never came to terms with it after my cousin molested me, i could probably never come to terms with something like this. i think im
looking for confirmation and closure that hes really gone but hes ok now because hes not in pain anymore. everybody else ignores me, i have barely any friends, ive spent my birthday alone or with my parents for the past 4 years. my boyfriend, 22m barely ever fucking talks to me, hes really sweet when he does but theres this constant lingering feeling like he just dosent care. hes in college and really busy so idk what to feel. dont even mention the age gap, thats not what im here to talk about and whatever your about to say about it i already know and have heard a thousand times before. ig it dosent matter bc i think about him about 100x less than i do kurt. he just dosent get me like he would. but im desprate for any affection, i stopped initiating it from my parents years ago. its not their fault, they have been through it all like me, and they love me as much as they are capable of, they are just as sick as me, but its almost worse because instead of constantly evolving and morphing, for better or for worse, like i do, they are completely stuck in their own ways. never changing, never getting worse but never getting better, well thats not completely true. with meditation my mom has gotten better over the years. my mom has bi polar disorder which heavily effected me as a child. i was stuck with her for the majority of it because my dad was in jail for beating her infront of me for most of it. he has npd and can never be wrong. ex con, multiple felon, drug charges, breaking and entering, violent crimes, the whole nine yards. he ""turned his life around"" and now makes a bunch of money hes racist now and has been clean for years but honestly id still take being stuck in that little warehouse with no bathroom door, a single matress and no furniture, malnourished and miserable while my mom tormented me as much as she loved me, a hundred times before id spend my childhood with my father. if i did id have probably killed myself way before id make it to this point. i still love both of them, i cant really fully blame them in a lot of ways they were sicker than i am. i dont know what to do with myself. i cant tell them. i cant ask for help, theyll put me back in the psych ward, treat me like an animal  and wont even help me. ill fail school if i go back. im already behind with a referall for not showing up to school because of my current state. the pills they gave me do nothing but make me worse. i need sedatives. i dont even want them to abuse them. i just want to feel ok. i genuinely get fits of anxiety so bad i cant sleep, cant move, cant talk, cant breathe. and they wont give me anything but fucking ssris that wont do anything. nothing works. a small amount of weed works but of theyd never give that to me for obvious reasons. i feel so stuck. i dont know what to do. this feels like the end but ive said that a hundred times before. they made me leave my best friend, it was probably for the best because that school environment degraded my health like acid eating through wood floors. but she was the only person who understood me even a fraction of what kurt cobain would. i feel like i cant live without her, and i guess im
not. i just hope i wake up and this was just a delusion from the meds, that im not really as sick as i am and that these new meds are just making me paranoid of something thats not real.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello everyone,
So I was getting real close with this person on Instagram who I didn’t even reach out to. She reached out to me. We hit it off real quick and became the best of friends. She always wanted to talk to me and she never missed a moment to talk to me. 

But then, she gets a boyfriend. He idolizes her all over his profile. Then reposts her pics without her knowledge or permission and blasts her all over his stories and posts like he just met an alien from a distant galaxy and won a huge prize. It was disgusting to say the least, especially since she’s only 14 and he’s almost an adult man. Ewww. He then boasts about how he’s gonna marry her and he literally just asked her to be his gf like a couple days prior.

When I first told her what he was doing, she was kind of uncomfortable with knowing he was doing that. I then warned her about the dangers of men his age in a loving and caring way. She was very grateful for the advice. We continue on as friends for about another week.

Then she starts changing. She slowly starts taking longer to reply, is not available as much, and is always on “active now” but never replies to me. She comes back with “so sorry! (Insert dumb excuse here) I’m going to bed now. Love you bestieeee!” Ok no big deal right?

Nope! The next morning I say “hello” she leaves me on “seen” and her profile disappears. It appears as tho she blocked me since you can find her profile on a web browser while being logged out. I tried texting her cell, no dice. I even called her but it went straight to voicemail. I guess she blocked me everywhere. 

But why!?! What the hell did I ever do to her! We were cool and we were inseparable. But I guess I was a fool for thinking that. Not only does she block me with no explanation, but she abandons me on the day I come down with a cold no less! Like WTF dude! This isn’t the first time this happens to me either. Seems like a pattern with people. They find a new partner, the friends all take a backseat. Especially the single ones. Ouch.

I’m tired of being treated like this. I get if someone needs space or a break but at least have the courtesy to tell me 5 words. I. Don’t. Want. To. Talk. Or even 3 like, Leave. Me. Alone. It hurts but at least I’ll respect that. But she didn’t even have the courtesy to do that. Why do people do this?!? Why would she break my heart like this after all the time we spent together?

Was she just using me to fill a void until she found a guy and I became an afterthought once he came? Or was he forcing her to stop talking to me because he got jealous of how much time I was spending with her. Cause that’s happened too.

Please folks, try to help me understand because I’m tired of this shit. Excuse my French.",Friend broke my heart,1742652614.0,1jh99wo
MentalHealthSupport,"
We (FF/49&45) have been together for 11 years, 8 of them married. We’ve been through lots of ups & downs life wise but never really relationship wise, we never had a reason to fight or argue, we calmly discussed our problems. We always got along wonderfully, we never stopped going on dates, writing each other sweet notes, chores are ~50/50 depending on who has more time & energy. 
About a 1 ago we started arguing every now & then but it resolved quickly until the arguments repeated again & again,we never really resolved the cause.. mostly issues with jealousy, being afraid I’ll leave her for someone else. Starting with her suddenly getting jealous & seeing everyone I’m close with as trying to get between us, no reason behind it apparently, on the way to a dinner party we argued & when we arrived I went to another friend & left her to go alone, I realize I should’ve handled this more calmly & I apologized for getting louder & leaving, since then it’s not really the same anymore, I don’t know if she got scared or anything, she knows Im not violent, I didn’t scream at her, I know she hates that, but I think she sees small issues as an argument already& getting upset as getting angry.  

She has a history of abusive relationships,went no contact with most family, she was diagnosed with cptsd/gad, battled addiction , suicidal thoughts,all before we met. It was never a problem for our relationship in my eyes, she was always more or less worried it would affect our relationship. Jealousy might have something to do w/ her body dismorphia which I think has been around since the jealousy started. She jumped from one diet to another from time to time. 
When I ask her what’s wrong she either says nothing’ ‘I’m just not feeling well’ ‘I don’t wanna talk about it’ when I ask her friends they say they don’t know, maybe a depressive episode which has happened in the past: she stopped talking to me told me it’s nothing, until a nervous breakdown, I supported her through therapy and everything seemed to be going well, after that we got married, bout two years in a similar episode, but resolved quickly. 

We barely talk sometimes, if we do we argue. Few days we actually act like a couple, I try not to ruin those moments by not mentioning anything about these issues.
I usually do her hair/nails, she asks me to do it, we make put a time, but then tells me she doesn’t feel like it anymore, I make breakfast, plan dates, try to talk to her, nothing from her side, she barely eats some days, she goes to bed at 7pm sometimes and spending much more time in bed.. I have no idea how to save our relationship. I think she thinks  I already decided for myself I’m gonna divorce anyway & there’s no point in doing anything about it. I’m willing to go to any therapy she wants, I suggested couples therapy she said ‘you don’t believe in that anyway’ I said that in the very beginning to a friend, idk how she even remembers that. She said ‘you’ll leave me anyways’ 

When I asked her best friend she said ‘maybe a depressive episode, please stay with her’  (To her friends she seems quite normal, despite being more depressed, she talks to them laughs w/ them, they go out together. ) What if it’s worse than that, last time it was her mom passing away, I would know if someone else passed away, what if it’s a bad diagnosis? Or hers?

It bothered her that I work longer or stay in the car for a while, when she told me that I came home early the whole week but we barely talked & spend the rest of the day in different rooms, following week I worked longer again she complained I don’t wanna come home to her, I told her whats the point if she ignores me, she said nothing & left. Half my friends are apparently flirting with me and wanting to date me, one she even titled as a competition to her. 

For everyone suspecting she cheated, I’d put my hand in fire, she’s the most loyal person I know.   I want to help her but I can’t if she doesn’t want any help or can’t even tell me what’s wrong..
How do I talk to her..

MentalHealthSupport,"Big big trigger warning for SH and hallucinations

So I've been in therapy for over half of my life (I'm 20) and I feel like I've gotten nowhere. I do understand that due to trauma, I have been masking a majority of my life. Autism was what started the masking habit but since I'm away from my abusers and am now in a stable place everything is falling apart. I've had a diagnosed ""anxiety disorder"" since I was 12 but it's gotten so much worse. I feel I've developed agoraphobia with how bad it is for me to even think about leaving my home. I get rushed with all of the things that can go wrong. It genuinely feels like if I leave, I'll die. I go into panic mode almost immediately. I won't leave unless absolutely necessary and even then it's insanely difficult.

 I've also noticed a habit of passively hurting myself. I'll hit my knees, purposefully run into things, even scratching my hands and neck to the point of bleeding. I think it's an anxiety thing but it's genuinely out of control. Sometimes these things are joined by intrusive thoughts of causing harm to myself. For example, if I'm doing the dishes and I see knives I have to walk away and stop myself from purposefully fileting my hands. Or stabbing myself. Wanting to throw myself infront of cars. Even trying to drown myself once on purpose. It's gotten harder and harder to stop these urges and I'm genuinely scared. I don't want to die and I don't want to hurt myself.

On top of that I just don't feel real. I think part of those urges is the need to feel something. Like assure myself that I am real. I feel like I'm operating a mech suit that I have no control over most of the time. It doesn't help when I see figures in the corner of my eyes and calling my name. Sometimes it's more than that. The hallucinations are what scare me the most because this makes it so difficult to be up front with my therapist. I've tried so hard to talk about these things with her but my body shuts down. It's like my brain is screaming for help but my body says no. I am my own enemy.

I've only ever been misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14 as a placeholder diagnosis. The only solid things on my chart are anxiety and depression. How can I bring this up with my therapist? What might be causing these feelings and urges? What avenues of research should I look in to? Please anything will be helpful. I'm only able to get this out because I'm copy/pasting this from a Google doc and not actually speaking.

I went to therapist in january, I realized I cant handle it all on my own and Im just too tired.

 Like a week ago I accidently told them in an argument that I wanna die and they reacted poorly. They yelled and threathened with adoption and mental hospital. Also said that ""I have no reason to feel this way"" and ""they didnt raise me like this."" I didnt tell my therapist about my suicidal thoughts and SH cause Im scared shes gonna tell them and Im scared of their reaction. But theyre gonna see my SH scars in the summer. I went too deep and theyre not gonna fade soon or even ever. I dont want them to know.

I cant believe she invaded my privacy like this. She also called my therapist to tell her this. I have a session in 3 days and she definitely will mention it.

I guess for me, if someone asked me the purpose is living a life without regrets and guilt, I know that no matter who you are,no matter what you've done in life, how successful you are, how rich etc, in our deathbed we're gonna gave regrets and guilt, my goal is to reduce those as much as possible, knowing how painful death is, my goal is to make it less painful.

I (19f) am a freshman in college in my second semester. When i was 15 i got into a horribly abusive relationship and did not leave for 3 and a half years out of fear and due to heavy manipulation. It had left me with horrible ptsd. I have also been diagnosed with anxiety and depression since i was 8 years old.

I understand Im all “young and spry.” But i feel like i wasted my life away. Its been years since ive had freedom and idk what to do with it. If i am without some sort of stimulation or if I am alone too long I get severe panic attacks. But when having free time i do not know what to do with it because i feel like its just too late for me.

Im not good with people, i dint have many close friends. I have a lovely boyfriend but hes social and goes out with people or does things when he wants.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out for advice regarding my 32-year-old brother, who has been struggling with severe negative thoughts, paranoia, compulsive lying, extreme jealousy and holding grudges for over 12 years.  His behaviour has seemed to worsen over the years. When he talks, he appears very delusional and out of touch with reality, and usually is hating on others - friends, family. He stays in this zone constantly. He refuses to acknowledge that anything is wrong and doesn’t understand how deeply his actions are affecting those around him, particularly my parents. 

He lacks good friends, hobbies, passions, a sense of responsibility, or personal growth, and has no meaningful relationships. His expectations from others and life are often unrealistic. He tends to take rather than give, believing that my father, mother, and I dislike him and don’t want him to succeed, and that no one is on his side. He feels as if the entire world is against him. His mind constantly feeds him these distorted stories, and it’s challenging to change his perspective. He spends all day in his room, isolating himself. He recently had a heart attack (he’s just 32), which we think might be linked to his long-term marijuana (or even hard drugs) use over the past decade.

We’ve been very patient with him, just listening to him without challenging his views because if we try to explain that his thinking is skewed, he becomes very angry. He also continues to insist that he has no mental health issues and that everything is fine. As a family, we are blessed to have each other, and despite everything, my brother is a beautiful human being and has a lot of potential. He’s just a victim of his own mind, and his thoughts and fears overpower him. We desperately want to help him break free from this cycle.

Given these concerns, I’m looking into potential brain screening tests to help identify any neurological or physical causes for his behaviour, any potential mental disorder. I’m especially interested in tests that don’t require him to verbally engage with his thoughts or emotions, as he’s extremely resistant to talking about his mental health. Is there any such test available? 

If anyone has experience with similar situations, or can recommend which tests might be most useful in this case, I would really appreciate your advice. Additionally, if you have any suggestions on how to bring positive change into his life or support him in breaking the negative thought patterns, it would be incredibly helpful. 

Thank you so much for your support and any insights you can offer. Never giving up on him or losing hope.

My whole life it’s been like this, apart from a wind down after a day of doing stuff I need constant activity, if I have an unstructured day where I’m clueless of how to spend it I will spiral into depression and next thing you know I’ve spent two weeks bed ridden and paralysed not leaving the house indulging in unhealthy activities like 14 hours of doom scrolling and masturbating and maladaptive daydreaming and will become dissociated from reality and depressed asf. This used to be the occasional blip I’d experience I could get over when I was in education or working where I had structure but I’ve been in a vicious cycle as I’m now a NEET due to bad anxiety and I’ve now spent most of two years in this paralysis state as I got no external demands or responsibilities, and it’s extremely difficult to get me out of it unless I have a real structure and daily plans.

MentalHealthSupport,"I have a long-time friend whom I deeply cherish. In a short time, we became confidants, soul siblings. But I feel like things might change.

She once attempted suicide, but her little dog walked into the room at that very moment and stopped her. She has been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while, and I’ve always tried to be there, to help in any way I could. But lately, I feel more and more like I’m running out of options. I know I’ve helped her a lot during these times, but it feels like nothing I do is ever enough. And it’s horrible—to feel this powerless while watching someone so important to me slowly disappear before my eyes. It’s almost like grieving someone who is still alive.

Lately, she’s been in therapy and taking medication for depression, but it doesn’t seem like anything is changing. Even when she says she’s fine, it feels like everything could fall apart at any moment. It’s like I’ve been on high alert for so long that even the slightest sign from her sends me into a panic. Over the past few weeks, she has been distancing herself, which has terrified me. In her darkest moments, I was there for her—but what if she has a relapse while she’s away? How can I be there if she doesn’t want me there?

While we’re not in contact, my body reacts as if I’m one step away from receiving the news that she has finally gone through with what she’s been planning for so long. And that possibility destroys me.

(I know that what she’s going through is far more delicate than what I feel, and I don’t blame her for any of this. But it’s unbearable to live every day feeling like I’m constantly on the edge, watching my world crumble in front of me and being unable to do anything. There were moments of such desperation that, in my madness, I even thought it would be easier if she had already done it—because at least then I would be free from this constant fear. But I recognize that was just a moment of despair. I would never truly wish for that. Still, I don’t know what else to do, and the thought that there might be nothing I *can* do is even more terrifying.)",being present can be like hell,1742600290.0,1jguxq5

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi, 20M here studying at university in the UK. 

I’ve found university to be one of the loneliest and most depressing periods of my life so far. As a kid you always hear how at university you’ll make friends for life and meet countless people… but my experience has been nothing like that. 

I get really socially anxious around people I don’t know and literally don’t know how to socialise with anyone who isn’t already a close friend, overthinking every little interaction. I’ve tried going out of my comfort zone by joining the American Football team in the university for a year but found it hard to find anything more than really shallow friendships, and have since been injured so can’t train or go to any socials and I’m scared to back after recovery… not sure why, it’s a completely irrational fear. 

8 or so months ago my partner ended a two year relationship… the way she did really hurt me and in all honesty I’m still not over it and it’s left me wanting to avoid dating entirely out of fear of losing anyone I do come close with. She was essentially the only thing keeping me together whilst at university and now that she’s gone I’m finding every day to be a massive struggle. Either binge eating or not eating at all, finding tasks like keeping ontop of laundry or keeping my room tidy to be monumental, I’ve even lost any motivation to do my hobbies like music, gaming, tabletop miniatures or coding. It sounds so corny but I genuinly feel empty and just like I’m living life on autopilot, floating through days of the week. 

I’ve tried reaching out to school councillors but I hate sharing my feelings, especially face to face. it makes me feel weak and vulnerable. As well as the fact whenever I do I burst into tears and become incomprehensible.

I'm very worried about my friend but at the same time, I can't stop worrying when the next panic attack will be when I'm with them.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello,

  
I'm a 24 old male and I've been depressed at least for 5 years. It has come to a point I've decided to try to finally get better - although, I've said that to myself before.

I'm currently studying my 5th year in university and I would graduate this spring. Instead, I've managed to complete a total of two courses. I have lied to my parents that I'm about to finish my bachelor's degree and I only need to get an apprentice job (or whatever it is called in English). Not only that, but I've built this web of lies how my studies are proceeding as I can't bring myself to confess to anyone - parents, relatives, friends etc. - that I haven't actually done shit. And I feel like it has only become harder to confess as the time and my lies continue.

During my second year in uni, my father appeared in my apartment on Saturday evening and found me asleep in my bed in my messy apartment. At that point I confessed I hadn't done any studies and so, he and my mom got me to see a doctor. I got a medication (not the first time btw) and went to see a psychiatrist. I got an admission note for a therapist but I never tried to get one. 

That spring, I actually managed to complete one course - all thanks to one friend from our acquaintance in the university. He sent me a message that we were put in the same group (the whole course was a group project) and asked if I was gonna attend - so I did. The second course I did consisted solely of micro exams which were quick and easy to do. That I did on my third year. After that I have tried to attend courses, I'd always sign up to a course, but never attend. Last year I almost managed to finish one course but couldn't bring myself to do all the required coursework.

Even the thought of trying to do a minor task for my studies feels like a burden. I manage to do that from time to time, but when it comes to bigger tasks (essays, big group projects, courses with a lot of work etc.) I feel overwhelmed and don't even try. Instead, I rot in my apartment, distracting myself with video games, TV series, movies, YouTube videos, porn... heck, lately I've been ordering a ton of food and gained weight thanks to that.

About medication: I've tried a total of 3 different antidepressants, first one before university, second one during my second year and third last fall. All three times I might felt a little better at first, but still wasn't able to study at all. I also stopped eating the medication cold turkey and felt nothing. I don't even know why I stopped. I guess at least this last time I kept forgetting to take my pills and I would take a double dose next day.

On top of not being able to study and constantly distracting myself, I've got other issues as well. My sleep schedule is a mess - if you can even call it that. I pretty much stay up until I feel tired enough to fall asleep easily, because when I try to sleep without feeling tired, I just can't. I don't shower or clean my apartment regularly and I barely brush my teeth. I need a complete rework on my dentals, yet I can't bring myself to brush them regularly. I haven't been able to make any new friends or get into a relationship. It has gotten to a point I don't even bother to try. 

I have all these dreams and plans of things I want to do now or at some point in life, but I can't start a single one - even when it's something I feel really excited about. My recent one is that I'd start going to gym and get in shape but so far - nothing.

Sometimes I feel like I'm not even really depressed. Like, I don't feel bad about myself per se, I just hate the position I am in my life and how it feels like there is no way out. I don't know where to start, I can't bring myself to seek help from my family or friends... like, I did try again last fall and got the medication but clearly that wasn't enough and couldn't then continue getting further help on my own.

I don't even know why I'm writing this right now. It's 8 in the morning, I haven't slept and I have to go to work in 10 minutes or so. What do I do? Where do I start?",I want to put my life together,1742623089.0,1jh1v4a
MentalHealthSupport,"Hi all , 

What is acceptance supposed to feel like ? Does it mean being apathetic to the situation? And not caring? 

I think not caring about anything easier but I just can’t do it . I care a lot. Maybe too much ? Is there a thing as caring too much ? 

Is acceptance something you force or choose or something that just happens? 

For example right now : current workplace has poor ergonomics which is triggering / worsening my pain and tension. It’s very hard to change it and it’s making me so frustrated and angry. 

I know what will make it better but I can’t execute the modifications.  

I’m doing things to make it feel better at home but I can’t help think if I go back to work everyday and just trigger my symptoms again I think I’m derailing my progress. Then the efforts feel like a waste , I’m just maintaining it from getting worse , not better. And I do feel the bad effects compounding. 

It would be easier to accept it but does that mean I just give up for sometime? because I just accept how bad it is and leave it be? 

Accepting is easier , my brain can stop needing to find solution and thinking but means I won’t do anything to make it better, and will get worse because I ignore. 

Also I find myself feeling really trapped and frustrated all the time with things that aren’t easily solved . Which also means it gets in the way of me doing the right things. With a lot of resentment and anger.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi,



I'm 25M, and lately, I feel like I'm starting to hate everyone. I had a close friend from college who helped me get into his company, and I was grateful for that. But as time passed, I started getting better opportunities—higher salary, chances to work in other states, and overall career growth. I used to share my work experiences and achievements with him, thinking he’d be happy for me, but he would instantly cut my calls whenever I spoke about work.



Later, through a mutual friend, I found out that he had been badmouthing me. Once, I told my friends about partying and dancing with girls at a pub, and he went and told them about how I got rejected in college and became afraid to talk to girls after that. Yes, it happened, but why bring it up just to embarrass me?



He also had a crush on a girl, but he would constantly criticize her dressing, how she posts pictures, and even trash-talked her and her ex to me. He said he’d never love her, but suddenly, he committed to her and hid it from me. When he finally told me, he acted like nothing had happened.



To make things worse, he’d mock me in front of others, saying I never dressed well before getting my job, and even told a senior that I wouldn’t be a software engineer without his help. I’ve decided to cut him off, but I can’t forget the past insults.

I stopped talking to him for 2 years, But he's still in my instagram followers list and couldn't block him because he will reach out to me asking why or through mutual friends and it would really embarass me. what to do ?

MentalHealthSupport,"(about trauma) Could someone help me understand what's happening?

Ps: i don't know if I chose the right tag. And I say ""trauma"" because I don't know what more to say, not because I have one defined. Also I am (at least was) gifted (like, in a neurodivergence way, so that can change how it experience trauma) 

Thanks 4 any help :)

I had like awful teenage years, specially for my parents, and highschool, and obviously without any help (including the psychologist, My parents were more clients than I was, and when that wasn't the case, they changed my psychologist). But the thing here is that I don't understand anything it's happening with me after that.

For the record, it all almost (as far as I know) ended at 17, and I think it started slowly at 12, more defined at 14, and the max was in 15-16. But I don't have at all the ""characteristics"" of a trauma. Since it ended, I don't know if it was since I was 16 or 17, my cognitive abilities have been progressively getting worse. And that's horrible, because I relied on them for everything. I could ask and receive help from my brain, and now I can't. I mean, my head and whatever my abilities reached has always been ""my home,"" and now that they're gone, they aren't. I mean, my ability to interpret, to analyze, the activity of my head in general, the ability to make decisions, to understand things, to learn, to remember, introspection, literally everything.Adding to that, my entire identity was built on reflections and introspection that without my abilities I am not capable of doing. 
Added to that were things like, at the end of 17 I suddenly started to taste blood in my mouth (without blood), which apparently it was anxiety (I had a CT scan), at 16 after a very strong anxiety attack (which I don't remember) I started hearing an engine in my ear, which went away, until now it has returned with the anxiety (cause I'm super scared of losing my skills), added to more things. It's like half my brain is shut off and everything is in half, There comes a point where it's not fog, it's just ""nothing."" My brain also has a really hard time recovering from everything, and sometimes it's like a part of it malfunctions, tingles, and blocks everything. Although I have limits even when I'm ""clear."" and I'm genuinely worried that it's physical. I'm going to see a neurologist next month. And my abilities also fluctuate, sometimes I can do something and the next day less but I can do something else, One day I can access and understand certain reflections and the next day I may not, etc. Although it doesn't happen just from day to day, sometimes it lasts for several days in a row. The point is that in one way or another it started right during the trauma or when it ended (little by little) 

But that's not the case. What I mean is that I don't have the problems that they say occur in trauma of ""guilt"", ""flashbacks"", ""nightmares"", ""negative perspective on myself"", ""a lot of dissociation"", I am not impulsive, nor unstable (not beyond anxiety), I don't overreact, I don't have triggers, I'm not emotionally dead or hyperactive either. etc. 

Just the other day I told a friend that I didn't understand how all the people who suffered from derealization hated it so much. Because in my case, when it happens to me, it just happens and it doesn't scare me. And my friend told me that in her case when she dissociated it was as if she were going to faint and leave the world (That only happened to me once, and more than dissociating, it was the opposite, and I thought I was going to die or go crazy because I was not able to sustain so much at that moment and it certainly was not my will, but not because I had dissociated). And that friend doesn't have experiences like I do. I know everyone is different, but I've been dissociating since I was a child over minor things, so I don't understand how it's possible dissociate so little in relation to what I suppose I should if I had a trauma. Like, Apparently, I don't fit into that part of ""trauma"" either.

But this is still not all. Now it turns out that my sister told me something yesterday that I didn't remember (of all things I don't remember). Apparently I often insulted her for no reason, just for things like ""she leaves the room and I insult her as much as I can as if she had done something horrible."" To begin with, I don't think she's lying. But It's not just that I don't remember, but it doesn't make any sense. Back then, I was obsessed with analyzing every one of my actions, being objective, not acting emotionally, reflecting, etc. I really tried very hard to be conscious of all my actions and do the most appropriate thing. Like, a lot. It reached a level where as a defense mechanism I developed a small mental voice beyond the one that was in charge to interpret everything objectively, to prevent my perspective from being distorted by emotions, and tell me to force me to put my feet on the ground, etc (like a kind of imaginary friend who, by the way, is no longer there, To begin with, because I don't have the analytical skills I had then, and to continue, because I'm no longer in that situation and it was a defense mechanism). I mean, I really made a lot of effort, so it doesn't make the slightest sense like, from what I remember it was then. 

I knew I didn't remember things, but I'm constantly bringing up more strange things in my memory that I don't understand:
1. My room, I don't remember anything about my room, in fact, I thought I had my room right after the trauma was over. And I even have memories of my empty room (while they were changing the bed) in the later stages of the trauma. And in fact I have memories where I thought that the trauma was over (during the changing rooms) (with the room empty)  But apparently they changed my room at the beginning of my 16th birthday, that is, during the trauma and at its peak. And from there I realized that I don't remember anything in my room other than after the trauma. 
2. I have two memories of my room during the trauma, but in the memories I am in my room from before, on the floor, and in a place that in the room where that memory happened I really couldn't have put myself, when temporarily, technically, that room no longer existed. I mean, the memory is real (I asked) but I have it in a completely different place. Those memories confused me too. 
3. I don't remember practically anything specific and especially not my day-to-day life at school. Or in home. I will remember at most 2 scenes (without dialogue) from all my psychologists in all those years, and I have had several. In fact, I have more memories at my father's house (where even I understood the experience was worse, and at first I thought that was the only reason for my bad adolescence until I started to think). (The room I don't remember is the one in my mom's house), I mean, I don't understand how I have more memories from where I had the worst time (as far as I know) if technically not remembering is a ""defense mechanism."". I'm protecting myself from the backhand or something. 
4. I also have no idea what my daily life was like in the room before mine, or at all. 
5. Then the thing about my sister, not only do I not remember it, but it doesn't fit. 

And like, more. 

The thing is that I don't understand anything, I don't fit into anything I see of traumas, what I am is what I was then at 16 but I can't even reach it because I have lost my cognitive abilities, I don't know what's physical and what's not, I don't understand my memories, and now I don't even know if the version of me that I held on to so much now with what my sister told me doesn't make sense, But I do remember all the effort I made regarding emotion and logic, that is, I don't know how to ""coordinate"" both things. Like, I literally just want to see if anyone understands anything about what I'm going through or has a similar experience, because I certainly don't.

I'm not expecting someone to diagnose me in this subreddit, nor am I expecting this to be a counselling session. I just need some advice is all! :))

I've been experiencing psychotic symptoms for the past year and a quarter, including hallucinations, fixed beliefs, disorganized speech and thought processes, and personality distortion (?). It's like my brain also makes links between things that don't make sense, and that I'm constantly on the way edge between having to manage my symptoms and not being able to. I had a difficult childhood, but none of my perceptions seem related to my hallucinations or delusions. I've processed what happened to me, and I no longer struggle with dealing with my past. However, when I visited CAMHs today, the clinician said that it's just ""a trauma response"", and that I'm ""too logical for someone facing a psychotic disorder, or any disorder at all"", which just seemed wrong. I don't want to sound like a know it all, or that I know better than an experienced clinician, but I can't help but feel that it's not a trauma response at all. My trauma response was stealing from my own house, and being deceitful, which has since dissipated, and I've not struggled with it for the past 5 or something years?

I am not too social and I never have been. Before when I was younger, I would stress out about time or get on edge. Like in highschool I would leave the house at 7:20 AM but if I left at 7:25-7:30 I would be really stressed out and wondering if I would even make it to school for 7:40 to give myself enough time to relax and get ready before class started etc.

The issue is, I am stressing out bc idk if there’s anything planned for that day at the time we wanna watch the movie or close after the movie. 

The issue I just thought of now while typing this, is I am not sure if I will be able to pick my bf up from his house. My college to my house on a normal day is 30-40 minutes. My house to my bfs house is 30 minutes. I’m just wondering if I’d be able to get to my car in the parking garage, and then make it to my house, change and whatever, and then go to my bf and then back to my area for the movie at 1 PM. If I am able to, then it will be cutting really close.

after doing some research, looking into their lore, even reading fanfics about them, i found myself completely attached over a matter of days. i found myself completely in love with him physically and emotionally. i basically know  everything about them. 

but for some reason, after seeing more and more content about him, i started to feel this sort of anxious, depressed, and maybe even suicidal feeling. i realized that he isn’t real, and he never will be able to love me. i won’t be able to live in his “universe” and experience myself in his life because it’s just not possible. it hurt. and it caused me to spiral into a depressive episode in which i genuinely thought about killing myself because it hurt so much. i know it’s psychotic and stupid, and incredibly farfetched and crazy. but it’s how i felt. i was truly in so much pain. and i couldn’t tell anyone because i knew nobody would understand.

i began avoiding everything about the character. the video game they come from, the things about them, everything. even one small mention even remotely close to him would make my heart sink and ruin my day. i always think that he’s watching me too. watching me go to school, watching me eat, everything. i’m still so paranoid and obsessed with him, even though ive tried to remove this character from my online world. 

and ive tried therapy. ive tried to journal, workout, eat healthy, go on walks, limit screen time, read, do hobbies. ive done research on how to heal. and i havent. i still feel the same. i even have good friends in which i hang out with, and talk to in school regularly. i do my homework. everything. and still, he will not leave my mind. and every little thing reminds me of him. ive even tried asking chatgpt for gods sake 😭 and still, im attached, and everytime i think about him i am filled with depression and anxiety because i know that he won’t ever be with me. i have no idea what to do. it’s gotten so bad that i can’t imagine myself being in a real relationship because i’m scared they’ll play the game in which he comes from and i’ll become depressed all over again. that, and the fact that i don’t want anyone else but him.

My relationship with my aunt has soured because of the fact that I've come here and basically been a live in aupair, uber driver and maid to her and her kids. 

A conversation came up two days ago where I was told that she no longer wants to sponsor me or continue to rent the house where I stay with my cousins..  She has also told everyone that my guilt is consuming me and that the decision to move out is my own.
Thus leaving me stranded. 

I don't know what to do, how to approach the situation or how to move forward. 
I study full time and as a condition of my visa have to attend classes in person (2 hours via public transit) and I work whenever I'm not at school.. I can't afford to rent on my own and I don't have my own car.. 

I'm so frustrated, hurt and feel utterly betrayed.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello everyone im (24m) have a big self hatred problem i cam here seek some advice how to handel it I will Apologise in advance becaus Englisch is not my first languagge and i have Dyslexia.


So it all startet around 6 - 8 years ago its hard to say the line really gets blurry so i cant realy say wenn it startet. Well around that time i gott into highschool sorta say the bullying kind of stop down. But i still was part of wierd kids club and in that time i startet resenting myself. It wasent extrem back then just slight hate towards myself. Then i startet my appritance ship and trade school well my boss back then was part of the we do it old way. Thats wenn i stqrt to realy hate myself couldnt realy do anything right even though they said i did alright in the end.But i realy didnt think i did 4.5 years later and went and did my military servic. And lets say as a Soilder it was okey i became a sargent and i just smoked did nicotin pouches and coffein to the max toke after the army 2 years to return to normal still crave it all. In that time i realy realy starte hating myself. Nothing was right and i nearly came close to ening it all in that time the 1 first time but i could pull myself back. After the Military took a new Job start working there and after 1 year ago a bit longer startet doing HEMA. And for some reason since that Sport requires self reflection i Startet realy getting depresses. Like Apartment not clean and to be honest i was an alkoholic with many dumb dessions. I drank every day 4-6 Beers if not whisky or Abshinth. And then my work suffer imensly and suddendly i stoop drinking my family start showin concer so i stoop and then i hade to face myself. Ill be honest brock down right then and there on the construction side. I came realy close to ending it agian twice in 1 week. One was more of a you know a kind of neard decision in the heat of the moment the other. It was planned realy enjoy plannig it for some reason. And then comes the part that i cant put my finger on to this day. My own self hatred witch was extrem to this point that i constently insulte myself inside like outside saved me. I felt this pure unfiltered rage and hate hoe i could be such a selfish asshole and Arogant piec of shit. And i stoped brooke down went to a therapist and talked with family and friends. Got my world back kind off worl throught with the therapist and my family and friends. Yes i  worked well the Therapist got back my life. But here is were the problem lies from time to time i get the taste of iron on my toung from the planned attempt and it gives me a  calm sensation. For wahtever reason it calms me to deep level for a short time. and i get dreams were i did in witch i did go through with my plans and i wake up happy. And frome time to time i crave nothingness it sounds crazy and all that but i just wished i hade nothing you know. nothing to think nothing to see just pure blackness and nothing behind it. It realy scares me to be honest that i would plan and do it again. I have talked to my therapist about it but he helped me merrge my hatred with my own personality sorta say its a part of me now i just need to live with and accept and its working well. But waht i still cant accept is complements. And now ill taik an example my sister (F32) mother of my nephew great little guy by the way. We talked and i told her about the dream and the taste and we talked and in the end she tells me. You have always been a bit more an emotionl person and shes never seen a more empethetic joung man witch has the abilty to share every problem and be like an open book and our whole family should trie and learn from me. Now she told me this and in my logic brain i new she is right i have always been the moste open of my famaliy and my friends i could talk about problems and give my complet honest opinion and i dont Judge. But i still csnt accept it i cant accept any form of compliments and thats were even the therapist has a bit of a problem and i told him that too i somtimes csnt accept waht he says to me.

so reddit sorry taking so much time out your day but i would appriciate if you have some advice or your thoughts on this.

I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and depression, and I am not coping with them anymore I really aren't, and I'm struggling with them, been diagnosed since I was 18 with both so they're not new things in my life, I have seen counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists and doctors about them since and I don't know why nothing is working, I'm on medication for them, I'm currently seeing a psychologist now.

I have attempted suicide multiple times, I have self harmed, with cutting, burning and scratching my hands and arms till they bleed, been kept in hospital overnight and the only way they would let me out was if I spoke to the crisis team and I lied so they would let me out.

I only have a couple of regular people in my life (mum and sister), and I have screwed up completely to the point my mum has washed her hands clean of me, I live with her, I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm having treatment for a lump which could be cancerous I don't know for sure till the doctors take it out and test it and all I could think of was this is it my way out, no more feeling tired all the time, no more waking up and hating myself and wondering how I'm going to screw up today.

I do stuff that I know is going to end badly but I still do them, I get distracted a lot, I can't stop fidgeting, I daydream a lot to the point I'm in my head damn near all the time, I get angry and defensive so easily and I react before thinking all the time, hell I act 90% of the time without thinking.

MentalHealthSupport,"I’m 18F and I’ve been in college for a month. In the beginning I struggled to get to school on time due to some physical health issue that caused me to sleep though my alarm. I got all that figured out but now I’m late because I’m burnt out. I have adhd and bipolar1. Yeah my school knows about this but I still feel like I will get kicked out. Even if I don’t get kicked out, what happens when a job scout comes and they go “wow she’s great at what she does tell me more”, and an instructor goes “yeah I know she is really good, however she never shows up on time”. ?

The past few days despite having a had a good sleep, I wake up and I’m like, “I can’t do this I’m not going”, and then I sleep in for hours ( in order to get ready and look “presentable” which is something we get graded on and is what job scouts are looking for, I need to wake up very early, and I have a very long bus ride to the school so that contributes to my early early wake up time to). I then usually wake up around or an hour after the time im supposed to have left already, and I still say I’m not doing this, and it takes SO MUCH convincing myself to get myself to go, especially while looking super worn out bc I don’t have time for makeup, and very unprofessional because I don’t have time to style my hair. 

I try to explain being burnt out to my administrators, teachers, classmates, friends, and family, but they don’t get it at all. “ It’s life, you’re tired (beyond drained and exhausted), you still have to try anyway”. But they just don’t know and will never know because they don’t have to experience it. To everyone, I am a lazy cop out who uses their mental health as an excuse to not “adult”.

I don’t know how I’m supposed to succeed in life. I’ve been fired from every job I’ve ever had as a teenager, one of them I got fired from for different reasons, one of them being I looked to drained and un presentable and it was unacceptable ( house keeping, not even a job where I interact with tons of people), when I was barely surviving, trying to make it through school, and just trying to show up to work and get paid, despite my mental illness, and I had bad PTSD at the time from witnessing something intentionally gruesome and violent in person at the time. I barely graduated high school, nobody, not even my parents had thought that that would happen. And I technically but unofficially dropped out in 11th grade and never went during that year.

I’m so exhausted, and I do things like getting lots of sleep, eating right, and stress management but it doesn’t help at all, and everyone around me is judging me for not being able to function properly.

MentalHealthSupport,"There's just always a million interpretations that can arise from a feeling and the thoughts it provokes. For example I feel a strong urge to flirt with girls any time I can now that I've started dating a little later than most. I can interpret this urge as resulting from a need for validation, wanting to catch up, satisfying repressed sexual needs, conforming to social norms, yearning to be loved, confronting fears or just generally bettering myself. And that's not even mentioning the counterthoughts, like I'm leaning towards the interpretation that I'm doing it for validation, but do I genuinely believe that (implying that I should slow down and reevaluate if I'm doing the right thing) or is that a protective measure my psyche conjures up to dissuade me from dating to avoid hurting my ego? 

At this point I feel like a stranger in my own body. I often have feelings I don't know the origin of, and while those feelings give vague pointers to what I should do to feel better, without knowing what motivates the feelings I have I can't judge whether they're grounded in my values. If I were to uncritically listen to my feelings I'd be gaming and masturbating all day. Therefore I feel that I need to filter out thoughts and feelings that don't align with my values, but how?

MentalHealthSupport,"The last time I felt excitement and happiness was when I was 18. 10 years ago.

My mental health decreased slowly. I used to put alot of effort into my health. I would jog, eat well, never consumes alcohol or drugs. 

I had 2 long term relationships since then, my last relationship turned me into a shell, with no personality and timid. I forgot what I liked to do and what I loved, trying to earn the love of a man who never intended to commit to me and used me like a convenience. It was really confusing, the phycological abuse was not damaging than the physical abuse. I believed everything he said, and did everything he told me to do- and he literally didn't have to do anything or give me anything except promise to love me.

In 2022 gave up on trust and finding love. I started drinking alcohol. I did any drug I wanted. I went from motivated and responsible to wreckless. I stopped working out, and I started eating whatever I wanted- mostly because I was trying to have a nice body for my boyfriend. So taking care of my health and watching my weight didn't matter to me anymore. My life revolved around his thoughts and likes. I wanted him to love me.

My question is, when do I feel better? How do I feel better? How do I start caring again? I miss caring about my pets, my life, my job, and myself.

I see a therapist and a psychiatrist. I take a ADHD medication now. 

I tried antidepressants- Zoloft, Prozac, Wellbutrin, and some others.The Wellbutrin made sucidal. The others made me unreasonably angry, I felt like I couldn't turn off my anger.

I picked up jogging and some weight lifting, but I don't love it. I hate doing it. I hate eating well too. I just want to eat noodles and that's it. I still have a couple drinks a day. I don't like to work anymore. I'm not passionate about my Future anymore. I hate where I live. I've tried to change my house but it still reminds me of the trauma. 

I feel stuck and burned out. And I don't have the energy anymore. I feel like it's getting worse. I miss how passionate I was about being alive.

I'm just having rough year and I can't seem to catch a break.  It started with my mental health being garbage due to being harassed at work.  I was being harassed because of being disabled.  I reported it, but she made up lies about me instead and management decided it was hear say.  I ended up applying for medical leave because I was really not okay and the harassment was heavily affecting me and if I didn't take action I was scared of where things were headed.  But I was denied medical leave and I ended up missing work a bunch because I couldn't get myself to go.  I was fired about a month ago.  Right after I was fired, my mom almost died.  She spent awhile in the ICU where it came to light she's been hiding an addiction.  There's another post on my profile that goes more in depth on this if you want more information.  My bio dad is also an addict and relapsed this year.  During this, I tried to confide in my best friend of 14 years who instead unfriended me basically because I confided in her.  There is also a post on my profile that goes in depth on this situation too.  My mom is in rehab now.  I'm still not talking to her.  And I know she's gonna get home and try to act like nothing happened and like we all should move on.  I know I'm making the right choices for myself by staying firm on my boundaries and refusing that this just be sweeped under the rug and forgiven right away, but it's so hard and exhausting.  I'm so tired of having to advocate for myself.  I feel like I'm the only one being reasonable here.  Everyone thinks rehab is the end of it, but the rest of my family doesn't know what it's like to have an addict parent.  This shit stays around and it's something we need to watch for for the rest of our lives.  And I personally will likely never trust her again.  And I kind of blame her for losing my best friend.  I wouldn't have had to confide in her so much if my mom didn't give me so much to need to talk about, not just recently but my entire life.  I know that friendship wasn't real or beneficial but it still hurts.
Now the newest development, my mom's friend that brought her the drugs while she was in the ICU just overdosed.  They are in the ICU now and on life support.  I'm pissed that they brought my mom drugs and enabled her addiction, but I'm also incredibly sad and scared.  This friend means a lot to me.  Despite their struggles with addiction, I always looked up to them as a queer role model.  They helped me so much with queer issues my family didn't understand.  They inspire me to be a safe space for queer kids some day the way they were for me.  Things aren't looking good.  And the idea of them dying feels like a weight on my chest and I can't sleep.  I'm so scared we're gonna get the call that they died.  I keep having panic attacks.  I'm heart broken for their kid and their parents who already lost their other kid to overdose.  I don't know how to cope with everything.  My OCD is also using this to convince me I shouldn't take my meds because maybe I'll get addicted even though they aren't typically addictive.  In the last two months addiction has been the biggest thing on my mind.  It's something I've always feared for myself.  So much so that before any of this even happened, I made the decision that I wouldn't be drinking this year because I don't like how happy it makes me and how sad I feel after.  It's not like I drank often, at most once every 2 months.  But I know I am predisposed because of my parents and I'm not taking chances.  I also never smoked or did anything more than drink on occasion.  But I have nightmares about being an addict.  I looked into the family members of addicts support groups but I likely won't be able to attend one until Monday.  The only positive is that I am starting a new job and it seems like a great fit for me.  But I'm also worried that everything going on in my personal life is gonna affect my work and I'll get fired again.  Like what if I need to take off work within the first 90 days for a funeral?  What if I'm at work and I get that call?  Or I get the call that my mom decided to sign herself out of rehab?  Or maybe something else entirely?

 Whenever I try speaking out about it, my parents always make it about them. And how I'd never survie without THEM. And how horrible I AM for literally copying the same tendencies THEY have. They don't actually hear me out the just scold and talk down to me to try and make me feel bad about it. Being happy is something I rarely see with my family. Mostly coming from my friends or my phone. I could be locked in my room all year and I'll be way more happier than I've ever been these past 3 years. Why? 

My relationship with my mom is horrible. She's the main minimizer of this relationship. And I can't fully hate her, she's done good things for me but also makes me feel very guilty for thinking I need help. I don't know why she started being mean to me.

"" You want to be those mental people? You want to be wrong in the head? "" Is common for her.

"" You know I'm not afraid to hit you. I will. "" Is also common for him. I don't want to be yelled at for not being happy with life. That's just me being ungrateful and being a spoiled brat.

I asked if the meds are only for people 100% diagnosed with depression or if they help anyone with symptoms. She said since I show the symptoms, they should help, especially with my low energy.


BUT I also told her I feel emotions super intensely, and after reading about the meds, I saw they can make things worse for people with manic episodes or certain disorders. Now I’m wondering if I might actually have something like BPD instead, since that overlaps with depression a lot.

MentalHealthSupport,"This is one of my worst overthinking months of my whole life. It's to the point where I can't talk to people without being paranoid that I said something wrong. 

It started when my friends from my sports team sort of told me basically all the drama in the team, and I realised how much I need to control what I say if I don't want to be a target. That led to me just not talking, even outside of the team from paranoia and I think everyday whether I did something wrong or not.  

And in school a lot of my teachers really dislike me, or is annoyed with me. And I do believe that I'm a good student (last sem straight As), but I'm falling asleep a lot more in class and I'm having more trouble focusing.

MentalHealthSupport,"I have a two part question... I've been through two psychiatrists, but how does one or how can one get truly diagnosed fresh?

Taken off tons as of last summer and put on new ones, things were good for awhile, but I'm back in a slump...
My other question, I watched baylen out loud, she went to tic-con in the series... do they have conventions for other disorders or like general ones for mental health? If so how do I find them, Google search didn't give me what I was looking for. I don't want support groups, I want to go to something like that.

MentalHealthSupport,"I'm 17 years old and I've struggled with my mental health ever since I was around 13. For that past year my mental health has been the worst that its ever been. Before I would go through small and short depressive episodes and then I would start feeling somewhat happy again. Lately I get depressive thoughts multiple times a day and when I'm at home I think about cutting myself with art supplies that sit on my desk in my room.

I would ask for help but the thing is, when I opened up about my struggles in the past to my parents, my dad didn't have a good reaction in my opinion. It wasn't a horrible reaction but the way my brain processes people's negative reactions make it seem like I'm the problem and it's my fault. The thing is, is that my dad has clinical depression and he was worried that I might have it (I still don't know cause I was never diagnosed) and so that's the reason for the poor reaction. The other reason to why I won't ask for help is because I don't want to, the thought of death makes me giddy and feel at peace.

I don't know what to do, if I should ask for help or let my thoughts consume me. I'm tired, unmotivated, I can't cry, I'm constantly overstimulated even though I'm not diagnosed with anything, and I just hate the world and myself.",I don't know what to do,1742434837.0,1jfdtor
MentalHealthSupport,"This past year, I was having a good time, and finally got over my ""ocd""/urges to harm others. Tonight, I realized something. I'm a bad person. I remember trying to put my cat in the microwave because my brain was screaming at me to. (the cat is fine, and still alive. but still, I'm worried I might've hurt my cat if I could. From what I remember, I didn't want to kill/seriously harm, her but still.) I was so stressed, though that doesn't excuse it. It's no different from someone like Ted Bundy. I constantly had the urge to hurt/assault. I tried telling my dad that I had urges to hurt others, but he said it was just hormones, but he did take me to the doctor. The doctor laughed when I told him everything, and decided to get me medication later. After having it explained to my dad that I needed quick help, I was sent to a mental hospital.

I remember the day before I went to the hospital, I tried to kill myself. I didn't want to hurt other people, and felt awful constantly. When my dad was notified, he told me to stop making him come home from work, and to deal with my emotions. I was getting in the way of his job. He didn't believe I was actually trying to kill myself. He recently admitted he thought it was something that I should ""grin and bear"" with.

Awhile passed, and I stopped feeling guilty pretty quick. People I knew told me that I wasn't evil. Though that's not true. Why else would I have those urges? People fucking say that I didn't really have the urge. No, I did. I had to hold myself back. What makes me different from the average animal/child abuser? I deserve to suffer.

MentalHealthSupport,"Those beautiful brown eyes, those beautiful brown hair, that beautiful face, that breathtaking smile, she was like an angel. That feeling of holding her face, that feeling of holding her hand, her in my arms, holding my arms where ever we go, the way she looks at me with all her love, the feeling of calling her mine, those are the most beautiful thing that a guy experiences. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen I know she was way out of my league. But when you get her with all her trust that is when you achieve it. Yes, I got her, I got that most beautiful she is like she has dropped from heaven, it feels like heaven is there where I am with her. She was my destiny. She was my niyati. 
Wanna know how I got her let’s start from the beginning,
I was studying in a hostel and it was the time of corona and we were all home. It was my 15th birthday and like every time at 12 I get all the wishes and then there was a special wish from the girl who was my classmate and we used to go to the same tuition. It was a very long text wishing me and remembering our memories. I joined the hostel when I was in 9th and at this time I was in 10th. Like every other guy, I started stalking her and then there was a pic of her in a white saree no not white it was a silverish saree. She looked too beautiful in that pic I saw that picture a hundred times before sleeping that is how beautiful she was looking. That was the most beautiful smile I had ever seen.  Then it was just a one sided crush I had nothing to do about it. Then there was my best friend who was even her best friend while texting him he casually asks me if I have a girlfriend I say no and then he asks me why you are good looking and why don’t you have a girlfriend. I tell him that I did find anyone who can be one and I ask him to find me a girlfriend. I was expecting her name very badly and then he gives me a choice of two girls in those two girls she was there. That made me so happy. That feeling was just different. Then I choose her and then he asks me are you sure I told him yes. And then it hit me what if she rejects me that would be very bad. He explains to me she is a very good girl and she won’t hurt me like that but still I was scared. Then he tells me that she was hurt by a person very badly that she cried for 3 months. There was a guy called Vaibhav who was her best friend who started liking her and then he confesses to her but she just wanted to be friends with him so she reject him then he abused her very badly that hurt her very much. She used to cry every day for that reason. So as a best friend, he makes sure that she would be safe and happy and I promised him that I would keep her happy. 
The next day he texts her about me and then she asks me to her. My hands were shivering to text her, so I give my account to my best friend to text her. She texts me and then I confess my feeling to her. She asks me to give her some time the next day she called me for the first time on July 25. We talked for one and a half hours the first time we talked. That was the best feeling I had. That satisfaction after the call. She asked me to call her at night and I did we spoke and days went by,  we became very close the day did not pass by without talking to her. Then on 15 Aug, she confesses her love like she proposed me, and then after 2 days, we met.  She had told her mom about me that I was her boyfriend and she was cool with it. The first time I met her was at her home where I took my friend. The first time she sees me she gives a long hug and I’m a hug guy who needs hugs we had talked about it so she gives me a long and warm hug. She takes me to her room we talk, her mom gives us privacy and also made us some sandwiches. I was very shy so I could not talk to her or eat her sandwich. Her mom was very good. At last, the hug and she whispers in my ears  “I love you” That gave me goosebumps. That was so special felt like never leaving that hug. 
There are two types of girlfriends in this world the one who gets jealous when the boyfriends look at other girls and the one who stalks other girls with her boyfriend. So my girlfriend was the second type. Then after some days, we meet in a mall we walked we ate and yeah we stalked others too we rated them. She asked me to find a girl whose LHS=RHS. If you know what that means. We had too much fun. She held my arms the whole time and never left it. That was the cutest thing. We started meeting very often every day was special with her. She was the best thing in my life precious that should be kept.
I’ve got two sisters and they are the best we share everything. I had a friend group of five in which my younger sister was also there. They were Samyuk aka Chintu, Ishita aka Appi, Vasishta aka Vasi, and my sister Srishti aka Chinnu, Ishita, and Samyuk were siblings they were my friends from 2nd standard. So we plan to go on a road trip to Sakleshpur where Vasishta’s family and  Chintu’s family agreed to come. Our parents did not come but they let us go with them. Two of them also join with us, Nithin and Lakshmi. So all the boys come to one car with Vasishta’s dad and Chintu’s parents and Vasi’s mom and the girls go in another car. We the boys had the best time we talked we played our favorite songs and Vasishta’s dad became so close to us that we started calling him Baba that’s what Vasi used to call him. He told us ghost stories in the car while Vasi was driving he scared the shit out of us, he told the stories that he had experienced. That was the best memory of the whole trip vasi’s dad telling us stories we also went to a fall where Vasi’s dad was the first one to get into the water and gave us some motivation and he found new places that were soo beautiful he was the first one to do the most fun things. He was the best. We had the best memories from that trip.
So, then it was time to go to the hostel before we meet for the last time in a mall she surprises me from behind hugged me from behind in public doesn’t leave for a very long time, we had the best time for the first time she kisses me on the cheek thank god I captured it and some of the boys tease us and then we run away from there then I walk her till her home kiss her on the cheeks for the last time say goodbye and then leave I go to hostel and used to call her every Sunday. Every Sunday we used to talk for five minutes yes it was hard very hard but we were handling it at the same Vaibhav started talking to her and I was ok with it I trusted her and I have no problems or insecurities. Then on Feb 10 I fall sick and one guy was maintaining a phone in the hostel who was very close to me and he gives me the phone that had no sim to use with the help of wifi because he knew that I missed her a lot. I used to keep the sweatshirt that I wore when I met her for the last time near my pillow. So I text her and send her a picture of that then she told me she wanted to talk to me and then in the evening I take a phone call from my warden. Then she tells me that her dad came crying to her that something had happened in their family that was related to a relationship one of her cousin was caught that left a very bad mark on their family. So he asks her to break up with any guy if there is one and then her mom tells her to do what she wants to so she decides to break up. Even if I was there in her place even I would prioritize my dad over her. At last, she tells me that I would never find another guy that is left to my dad and she asks me to call on the coming Sunday. I go to my best friend Moiz I hug him and the tears started falling I cried too much he handled me and made me understand. I was in no state to talk to her I did not call her and Sundays pass by without calling her. Then on March 31, it was her birthday I call her she acts like she doesn’t even recognize my voice then I tell her wish her talk for some time she asks me if I have found a new girl I say no, and then after keeping the call, she calls me once again I say HIII yes the excited one but it was not her it was her mom she asks me to never call again because she gets hurt. So I don’t call her again. 
The summer holidays come and I come home there I see was still following her on Instagram many new dance videos of her made me feel very bad I couldn’t handle seeing her so I unfollow her and then after some days she blocks me that made me regret doing that. Then there was no way to reach her I felt that was good but that made it worse it made me miserable her more but I had to move on. I couldn’t move on because I loved her very much no guy can ever move on with their first love. Then I go to the hostel the days pass by I was happy with my friends they were the main thing in my life that made me happy made me laugh made me understand.
I missed her every day I used to talk about her all the time and the days passed by. From Jan 9 I had my Sankranti holidays every time the driver used to come to pick me up but this time my father and sister come to pick me up. I was very happy that they came to pick me up I sit in the car take my sister’s phone and start scrolling and watching stories then in one of the stories of my best friend who made us meet. In his story, there was a picture of her and there was a caption that “You will be missed” then my sister snatched the phone I ask her what happened and she tells me that she committed suicide I ask her why she tells method she doesn’t know I look and her forget to breathe after some time take deep breath tears start falling couldn’t control myself start crying very badly they make me drink water I handled myself I come home I sit on the sofa and I take my mom’s phone and I casually check the gallery and I see a screenshot of a status of someone of Vasishta’s dad and then I saw the caption and it said RIP, I was broke I go lock myself in the room started getting all those memories and cried it all out my sisters come to try to handle me but that did not help I just wanted to be alone but my parents were too scared to leave me alone in the evening I go meet Vasishta in the evening and he tells me that his father had a disease called early Parkinson it came to a point where he had to take tablets every 2 hours and her couldn’t handle it and shot himself. I hug him and comfort him by telling him that we are there for him.
After some days I go meet her best friend who was even my best friend and another on of my best friend I ask them the reason for her doing that and even they did not know and my best friend tells me that there was story of her being very close to vaibhav and I ask her to send me that and in the evening it was one of my sister’s birthday we went to a family dinner and while coming back she send me the pic I saw her sitting on vaibhav and other pics which were very close and my sister tells me that there were rumors that they were in a relationship and I did not believe her and laughed at her and then I go to my room and ask her best friend that were the in a relationship and she replies that yes they were and continues that it did not have to be this way, I was broke I become numb and then after some time I text her was the reason for our break up was true or not then she tells me that yes it was true her father had become very strict and used to sit beside her all the time for some months but after some months he had become little less strict and that’s when this happened it was just 3 months before her passing away they got into a relationship.

So this was my story and the main thing of this story is how did I get over it someone has rightly said that “ If you really want to be happy in life start pretending that you are happy and you will really be happy “ when you are depressed never pick things that can hurt you rather play your favorite song start dancing go to you friends or family to make you feel better. I was lost for some time a very long time actually but I have got good sisters and friends who got me over that phase even you will have someone in your life who can make you happy go to them and if you don’t have one make one meet new people who make you better person never be scared of getting hurt because remember you have had worse of that. Be positive all the time, I only feel good for the good memories that I have had with her whereas I ignore all the bad memories. I only embrace the good time that we have had. Remember all the things we’ve done together even now when I hear her name or remember one of her memory it feels like there is a knot int my breath. You know you will be very good until people show sympathy on you and to avoid it is to not let people know what you have been through be normal get along with them never let them know about your past life your life would be blissful. 

My journey with her was very short but, she has become a memorable one for lifetime. And lastly I just want say “I’ve known love because of you. This pains me, but I hope you are in a better place now, Niyati. I love you always.",I love you always,1742446056.0,1jfh77e

To keep it short my cousin ghosted me for around a year, and now he wants to “fix things”

Well I don’t know if I want to. I mean how can you ghost your own cousin accidentally? You know, unless it’s on purpose, either way I wasn’t in his mind.

Now the problem is his family is forcing my family to make me fix things, and my family is heavily favouring him.
Now even though what he did was wrong (it made it worse that I had no friends I just had graduated during this time)
I’m seen as the bad guy now because I don’t want to fix things, so now if I forgive him I’m basically doing a disservice to myself because I don’t want that energy with me but I got no other choice, except one.

This stresses me often and I think I’m gonna do something stupid at first it’s I would just break his phone pretty things but this isolation period really messed my mind up.

Just want to start this off saying I’ve never really used the Reddit app so I apologize if anything is confusing. Also I might not be to specific so and might have lots of misspellings. (Trigger warning for talking about starving and Self harm).

Currently I’m living with my parents. And through 2023, I had pretty bad time doing anything. I starved myself and self harmed. I ended up eventually helping myself back up and I’m currently over a year clean on both of those. I worked really hard on my mental health in 2024! But it’s definitely not enough… I’ve always felt like I needed therapy since 2023, but was immediately shut down at the idea. Mind you none of my parents know any of this, they just know I had a hard time during 2023 but that’s it. I trust my mom more to talk/ask her about it but I’m honestly terrified to.

I have no motivation and all I want to do is lay in bed… I don’t know if maybe I just need a little push or advice from a stranger, but I don’t know how to ask my mom for therapy or advice. She’s a good mom but I don’t know if I can talk to her on that kinda level. I don’t want to just spill everything to her but my birthday is coming up in less than a month and I’d like to be more at peace by then. She also wants me to have a summer job, I had a small one for the past three years but since someone close to me won’t be with my I probably won’t be working there. I have really bad social anxiety and struggling talking to strangers. Not so much at school but definitely in public. I honestly would rather work on myself but I feel pressured to do all these things when i can barely find the strength to do my laundry.

Honestly any advice would help if it’s therapy options to suggest or maybe things I could do by myself as I try to be very independent or what I could say to my mom. Sorry if this is a rant or confusing but I wanted to explain myself for hopefully some advice.",Life advice??,1742424014.0,1jfa029
MentalHealthSupport,"Hi everyone. I have a friend with some pretty severe childhood trauma. And without giving away any potentially triggering details, I can tell you that what she endured as a child is literally the worst of the worst and ended up leading to her developing a whole bunch of both mental and physical health issues. 
So here’s some background info about this friend. She’s 50 years old, unemployed but lives on a large and extremely beautiful property in the country with a bunch of rescue animals. To people looking in from the outside, they would think she has it all. But her childhood trauma has lead to her having really severe depression and PTSD which she copes with by taking sleeping pills. She doesn’t drink or use any illegal drugs, and she often speaks very proudly about this, because I don’t think she understands that the way she takes sleeping meds is an issue. There have been countless times over the years when she told me she took so much medication the night before that she didn’t think she would wake up and this absolutely terrifies me. She also doesn’t have a set schedule, which is one of the worst things you can do when you have depression. She often sleeps all day and stays up all night, doesn’t keep her house clean and just struggles to function overall. But despite what she has been through, she is the kindest person I know. Not one of the kindest, THE kindest. I have no idea how someone who has endured so much cruelty, could turn out so kind and all I want is for her to be able to enjoy life. 
I’m hoping to visit her over the weekend and I really want to chat with her about my concerns. But I’m afraid that she might not be receptive. The irony about this whole situation, is that I am also very mentally ill, with my own list of diagnosed mental health issues and traumas, which is actually why we clicked so well. So I 100% understand where she’s coming from. 
But I’m afraid that if she doesn’t change, she’s going to overdose or worse, stay the same and never get to be happy. Would anyone have any advice on how I could approach these very delicate issues? Or how I can support her if she isn’t receptive or open to change? I love her so much, and I don’t want to lose her and there is nothing more that I want then for her to have a chance to enjoy life.

MentalHealthSupport,"Over the last year I've noticed a slight shift in how I veiw myself and how I view other people. 

I used to be a very caring and empathetic person, it was one of my core traits. I don't wanna give a bunch of examples as to not look like I'm super egotistical. But I rarely judged other and honestly still don't. But I used to care, I wanted to understand who someone else was, what they were going through, what made them laugh, what made them feel happy. I wanted good memories with the people I love. 

But now, after some questionable situations with really damaged people, I rarely feel much more then dustain or a sense of indebtedness towards someone else. Though this bleeds out in most interactions I have with most people. Like feeling anger when a cashier makes conversation, or a coworker tells a joke. It's most noticeable when someone complains to me or crys to me for help. I feel disgust, it just seems so pathetic and manipulative.

I was in a relationship with someone who would cheat on me and use suicide to get me to stay. And my one parent uses the ""I'm such a peice of shit, I have no one"" approach. Both come from incredibly traumatic backgrounds and so I dumped alot of energy into trying to help them see the good in themselves, or hope in the future.
But at this point 4 years being directly responsible for someone who has these types issues. I just can't take emotions seriously, especially my own. I think I'm manipulating myself whenever I feel anything concerning myself. All the reasons I would cry just seem so pathetic.

Hello all,

The following text is summarized by chatgpt. Thanks to my scrambled brain,  the initial number of words were around 4000. I summarized it to get to the point using chatgpt. I tend to deviate and add a lot of points that may not be required so I used this.

Also I have a tendency to elaborate something that can be communicated in a simple sentence,  and I apologise for this.

Thank you for your patience to read through everything. //


I was raised by my single mother after my father passed away when I was 15. She loved me unconditionally, but I struggled with consistency and discipline. Despite bursts of energy and focus, I failed at basic responsibilities—studying for exams, attending college, and taking care of my health.

 My procrastination and tendency to seek distractions led to deep guilt, self-hate, and episodes of running away from home at 11 and 18. Both times, I was overwhelmed by feelings of failure and even considered self-harm. My loved ones found me and showed me I was cared for, which kept me moving forward, though my struggles remained.

I fell in love with a woman who encouraged me but also isolated me from my friends. We married, had a son, and things quickly turned toxic. She became controlling, used our child as leverage, and even joined a cult church,  changing our son’s name without my consent.

 Eventually, she falsely accused me and my family of domestic violence and assault, leading to a seven-year legal battle that took everything from me. COVID prolonged it, but I was eventually cleared of all charges. We divorced, she cut me off from my son for four years.

Recently, she reached out with regret. I refused reconciliation but discussed our son's future. After years of being kept away, my son has now agreed to meet me in a month.

Yet, despite overcoming so much, I feel paralyzed in my professional and personal life. I work remotely and have vast experience in some areas but lack confidence in others. I have opportunities to grow, increase my income, and improve my life, yet I fail to take action.

 I lost a business deal because I couldn’t send a simple email for weeks. I have a business opportunity but haven’t even started preparing. Instead, I spend 14 hours daily mindlessly scrolling social media. I dread talking to clients, but I prolong trivial phone calls with friends to escape reality. It's like there are others working on the deliverables but I just become a bottle neck and the entire thing just stops bcoz of my inaction. It could be as simple as forwarding to the client an email with an attachment sent to me by my team members.

I binge on junk food daily while forcing myself to the gym 3–4 times a week. 

My biggest fear is that my son might inherit my struggles—the inability to take action despite knowing what needs to be done, the tendency to procrastinate, and the addiction to distractions.

What’s Next?

I know I need to take control, but I don’t know where to start.

I have opportunities to grow professionally, but I’m stuck in a cycle of inaction.

I have a second chance to be a father to my son, but I fear failing him.

I have dreams, interests, and goals, but I can’t seem to execute them.

I don’t want to be stuck in this cycle anymore. I just don’t know how to break free.

MentalHealthSupport,"This is a follow up from my last post.

Well, I may be getting fired today. It’s very much deserved, I thought I could go without therapy to fix my lying problem, but nope. It has now gotten worse than ever. Yesterday I made the biggest f-up of my life and will probably lose my job because of it. I don’t care about throwing a pity party for myself, I worry for the coworker whose trust and kindness I took advantage of. I don’t know what my next move is, well, besides therapy.

I start therapy tomorrow and I’ve already come clean to my mom and my brother. I’m working on making strides to do better and dealing with the consequences of my actions are one of them. 

I’ll keep everyone posted.",I may lose my favorite job because I am a pathological liar,1742316679.0,1je9mh7
MentalHealthSupport,"I (F2O) am feeling quite overwhelmed and anxious right now. These feelings are really difficult to put into words, but I'm going to try my best. For context, I'm in a relationship with someone who is 5 years older than me and in my last year of a university degree. Basically, I'm really struggling with confidence/comparing myself with my peers and partner. It's such an awful feeling, but I just feel like I have nothing going for me, and everybody else does. This whole thing was so much worse last year, but in November, I started going to therapy and it has improved somewhat. I've come to the realisation that although I love what I studied for my first degree, I think I'm going to go ahead and pursue a second degree in a related area (getting a bachelor degree is free where I'm from). I've also started exercising and doing yoga, and making art like pottery and writing. 

Despite this I really struggle with anxiety and this constant feeling of being ""incomplete"" and as though everyone around me has it much better than I do, or that they're going to make it and I am not. This has been amplified recently because I failed my driving test and it absolutely crushed me (this was my first attempt.) My car is bought and my parents pay for my lessons, so I also feel really guilty that they're going to have to keep doing that. I'm terrified that I'll never pass, because I want it really bad. I'm mentioning this because since I failed it, the feeling of being a failure has been amplified by a thousand.  I feel like I should have my license by this age. I'm ashamed. Every time I catch the bus, I feel this sense of shame because some of my friends have their license, my boyfriend has it, and I feel judged or looked down upon. 

I also have really bad financial anxiety paired with guilt. Luckily, my parents have always helped me out, and support me furthering my education, but I feel so bad that they need to provide for me. My partner also works in a very respected and high earning field, whilst I'm interested in teaching and working with children, so I know I definitely won't be the breadwinner in the relationship. I just have this massive anxiety around money, and spending my own money on myself (which I work hard for). My family was never in a financial crisis, so there really isn't anything in my past that this can stem from, at least not that I know about. 

Has anyone had to deal with this innate shame and guilt? It's exhausting and I feel like I'm doing all the right things, like seeking therapy, indulging in hobbies, and exercising. I don't know what else to do.",Intense Anxiety,1742317955.0,1jea5a8
MentalHealthSupport,So basically I almost killed myself twice but I heard my cats whinging and I don't want em to miss me and I'm in middle school rn so Im afraid to talk to anyone bc they might bring me to a school counselor and my phone is another thing keeping me alive because about 55% of my social life is on there and without it I feel lonely bc I can mainly talk to my gf on my phone and my dad is gonna take it away forever because I'm failing and I feel like Im not suicidal despite me almost killing myself and I don't tell my family anything because I don't want them to worry or be sad and I don't know what to do it's been declining since trump won and I'm a closeted transgender that only 10 ppl know about and I'm also scared that it's gonna get out and I would be killed and I don't know what to do with my life anymore and my parents are not  abuseive there not perfect but there semi good and Im afraid there gonna make me go to a therapist and then if i do they will say everything and I really don't know what I'm doing with my life I'm a fucking disappointment I'm probably gonna repeat the grade and I feel guilty because I'm almost killing myself over my phone even tho it has a good chunk of my social life and now I'm asking reddit for advice somebody here please give me advice  ,I need advice on this please,1742323210.0,1jecbns

MentalHealthSupport,"I’m in my last year of university. 2024 started off tough, I was dealing with depression that I have had since around 16 years old. I then started to work on myself emotionally and mentally, and by May felt really good. I had made good friends with those around me and gotten into a relationship for the first time with girl I genuinely cared about a lot however that ended. 

Since I returned to university it feels like my life has been in steady decline. I don’t speak to my the friends I made last summer from university at all, when I do see them it is very awkward and it feels as if they really don’t like me at all anymore. I saw my friends who I’ve know my whole life from school the other day an it was terrible. I always thought it didn’t matter too much what happened at university as I had them. It just felt as though they didn’t enjoy my company at all anymore. I over heard one of them say, “no chance I’m sitting over there next to him (me)”. I don’t think I have really changed as a person. I don’t understand what I’ve done. I am so confused as to how and why this happened. About 8 months ago my life felt amazing. For the first time ever I feel like a loser and a burden and extremely insecure. I’ve struggled with mental health for a while but this is new. I’ve never felt so hated by those around me.

MentalHealthSupport,"Does anybody know why I have a lack of feeling emotions entirely? I don’t feel happy, sad, angry, scared, or anything else really. I can still feel feelings i guess which I consider different. I can still feel annoyance and anxiety and love and all that but in terms of emotions I am unable to feel anything at all. Something that really confuses me is im also not sure if this is bad or not. If i could feel I think I would probably be scared about this but as I feel a lack of emotion, I feel ok with this but I am not sure it’s a good thing. To summarize, I dont feel any emotion, I feel weirdly fine with it, and im not sure what I should do. Is there anyone here who has any experience with this or are familiar with the problem?

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi everyone,

To be honest I’m not sure how anyone can help me right now but I’m having a really hard time. I’ve been struggling with mental health issues for most of my life and have been seeing a therapist for a while. I’ve hit a point again where it feels like nothing seems good enough and I’m pretty lonely. Realistically, I am having a hard time not just bed rotting all day. I’ve been doing stuff and even felt productive today (I went to classes, grocery shopping, etc.) but I feel like nobody wants to deal with me anymore and it’s really getting to me. I feel like I’m constantly treated like something that needs to be fixed. People say they are on my side but then contradict themselves and say that they can’t handle watching me go through med treatment and stuff again. I’m just feeling really depressed and kind of hopeless. I’m struggling lately to have motivation or feel like my life is going anywhere. It just feels like I’m wasting it away. My friends are getting married, having kids, etc. but it feels like my life is going nowhere. Sorry, I know this is a lot of random info but I feel like I have no one to actually talk to right now. I feel alone in this and like I’m going to be abandoned by friends and family because I’m just too much to deal with. ",I’m feeling really stuck right now,1742335930.0,1jehhl1
MentalHealthSupport,"I'm struggling right now.  I've been unmedicated and out of treatments for a while now due to several financial setbacks. I used to have a (small) social life, which I had to pull back from ($). I've become isolated and my family does not see me as good enough because my attempts to better my situation are unsuccessful so far. 

Today some family were visiting from out of state and offered to buy lunch. They asked what I wanted, then as soon as I said what I liked, my mother snapped that I ""could make that here"". She was neither paying for nor driving to pick up the food, but she just had to shut me down and shut me out. After this, I just shut down, went quiet, and eventually just locked myself in my room to avoid her.

I feel like I'm not good enough for her and it's getting harder to pull myself out of that mindset.

MentalHealthSupport,"I have been dealing with creative burnout for a couple years and am at a loss for what to do. I’ve tried to take long breaks to enrich my passion again but it’s not working. I burned out emotionally soon after going through something traumatic, and have been diagnosed with PTSD. I do believe it’s the PTSD, but also more than one thing causing it. (Like being a perfectionist) I am getting closer to starting college. I really wanted to do art but now that’s out of the question since I’m still recovering. It’s the only quality I’ve developed heavily so it feels difficult letting it go. 

I’m overall just stressed, exhausted, and struggling with my faith that I can get through this. What worked or is currently working for anyone? I feel like hearing some success stories would help a little. Thanks for reading. 🙏🏻",What helped you recover from burnout?,1742344114.0,1jekibv
MentalHealthSupport,"I’m at a loss for what to do since I burned out in 2022. I have taken a long time and multiple breaks away from art but it still feels like nothings working. I miss picking up a pen and drawing. I did go through a traumatic event that caused PTSD a couple months prior to the burnout but think it could be multiple things, not just PTSD related. I’m a perfectionist which can cause me to self-sabotage. But really, I don’t know exactly what’s causing it and I feel hopeless that I will recover completely soon. I wanted to go to college for art but that’s out of the question now… because I don’t think I’m ready to return to it. It’s hard to let it go because it’s my most developed quality.

Guys please give me any idea tha can help me either by comment or by inbox. And i am going to explain my complicated difficult problem.
I am 35 years old man and when my age reach near to 15 i start to feel some strange desires. For some time iwere ignore it and i were seeing it as nothing. And i tryed to forget it simply. But it was not as simple as i think and absolutely i cant take out it from my mind. At the same time from the point of view of my religeon, culture and my personal behaviour it this new desire was extremely taboo and major SINN. These my strange desires are being owned by others the whole my life and become their property. And then i need different strange and brutal things from my owner for example to be tortured different parts of my body using different pinpoint materials, sharp materials, brutally tied by thin strong cables, brutally bitten, ect. Also in addition to the torturing also i need from my owmer to make me to be amputated all my limbs and live being DAK DAE quad amputee by stump crawling. Then my owner by making me their limbless slave/limbless property i need from them to make me to live by doing things by myself wthout limbs and also without the help of others. I like the rest of my life to be like this to live the difficult and challenged life with the extreme torturing. The above is my the extreme desires i am living. I am living fighting with myself for two decades. Therefore i need your helps, what shall i do? What you will advice me? What you will help me. I think it is mental health problem and these horrfic desires should have to be stopped. But how? You can say whatever you think and i am open to discuss with anybody freely. I hop i will get the direction of how i can be healed from this problem. Please help me and take out me from this hell and i am waiting you. Thank you!!",Need your help,1742350469.0,1jemmh2
MentalHealthSupport,"I've had depression for as long as I can remember. It's never gone into remission, but l've had periods where it was a little better. But the last couple years have been so hard, the last few months even more so.

I lost my job recently. Looking for a new one seems impossible. My house is a chronic mess. Many days I can't even bring myself to leave the house. Even the tiniest tasks feel too difficult. I've lost interest in everything I used to enjoy. I can barely take care of myself.

I've been to so many doctors and therapists, on so many medications, l've tried alternative therapies, and supplements, and exercise, and meditation. And now l've lost my health insurance, so I can't even afford to try anything else.

I'm in such a bad place and I don't know what to do.",Not sure what to do,1742351445.0,1jemxio
MentalHealthSupport,"( there is a TLDR at the bottom if you dont want to read this all )

So here is my story so you can get to understand why i have accepted my own mortality and that i will die one day

So for started my older brother has a condition that has causes little holes to form in his lungs where air leaks in and when the holes close pressure can build up and eventually his lungs pop and collapse, they finally did a surgery to fix it after his lungs collapsed and they fixed it for the 9th time, he has staples in both his lungs, and is missing a third of one of his lungs. While this genetic illness is most common ( but still very rare ) in men its even rarer in woman but i was unlucky and also ended up getting it, while my lungs have yet to collapse i have already had multiple micro pops since high school ( im 20 now) which cause some chest pain

the thing is with this illness you cant predict it. As im writing this right now one of both of my lungs could just tear apart in my chest and there is NOTHING i can do to stop it. Even the surgery they figured out to fix it they can only do AFTER my lung collapses per lung so my lungs are rn just time bombs waiting to go off

I learned my lungs where like this from a blood test at age 5 so already i have been aware of my own mortality from a very young age

I later read a book series in elementary school called ""a series of unfortunate events"" and in the 5th book i learned the saying Memento Mori which is Latin and pretty much translates to ""accept your death and that you will die one day"" and i did, i realized that saying was the moto of my life now and i lived with it even to this day. I know im going to die and it could happen any moment and i accept it and i will just keep living my life, watching anime, playing soccer, going to college, ect

I also have a heart condition i learned about in high school that makes my heart so sensitive to medication that most ADHD meds make me pass out and further increases my risk of heart attack

I have also been close to death in other ways, I almost drowned in a rushing river after a flood in 8th grade, broke my skull open at 2 years old and still have a scar on the back of my head from it, and Hell my mom even told me it took 3 days for me to be born since i had the ambilocal cord around my neck AND she smoked while pregnant with me which has deformed my ribs

The main part my friends find concerning about this is the fact i fantasize about my own death and even planned stuff out if i do die since i was 17 years old

when im bored in class i imagine if someone broke and with a gun or something and play a few scenario's. 2 where im the hero but i die in one but live in the other both of which are more unrealistic like im the hero in an action movie while the other scenario are me either me dying realistically or me saving the day realistically and i think about how that would effect those in my life as well i do the same thing when im falling to sleep if someone was getting mugged or robbed and my friends find that concerning

they also find it concerning i have rn in my wallet i have a piece of paper that tells where i hid a key to a small safe of mine, in that safe is one thing, a piece of paper that contains a password an email, the only thing i have used this email for is to create a Google doc. Said google doc has a list of who i want to go to my funeral which i update every few months if i need to, personalized letters to every single one of my close friends and family members, orders to give all my money to my niece and nephew, and who to give certain things of mine to. I wrote it since if i suddenly die today, tomorrow, or in a few years i want to make sure people know how i cared about them, i want to make sure people get certain things, and i dont want to risk anyone missing my funeral

I told my friends about it and even where the key to said safe is just incase when i day my wallet is lost they can get to the piece of paper so my final messages to everyone is not lost and what i want to happen after my death is not lost

They all think im way to comfortable with my own mortality and are concerned for my mental health but to me its just part of life

If you read all this thank you i know its pretty long but apricate if you made it all the way threw

What are your thoughts? am i weird for this? am i to comfortable with my own mortality?

TDLR: I have various heath conditions that have made me know from 5 years old i could no joke die as im writing this and have been near death many times. Because of this i do fantasy's where im a hero and either live or die trying to stop a school shooter or save some one from being mugged, and also have a google doc with my last wishes planned out, personalized massages to all my friends and family, and who i want at my funeral incase i die suddenly and i told my friends about it incase the piece of paper in my wallet that directs people to the google doc is lost they can still find it and there concerned about me for this since they say a 20 year old should not be this ok and thinking about there own death so much and are worried about my mental health.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi all, looking some advice or insight if possible about my cousin (M23) who has previously been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, but I now strongly suspect that there's something more serious or sinister. 
We've convinced him to come to the hospital in the morning, but based on the below symptoms, could you please give your thoughts on what may happen?
SYMPTOMS: Irritable and restless, unable to sleep, more energetic, disturbingly 'positive', reports thoughts and desires of suicide and self harm and is delusional. Sadly he's awaiting sentencing from court and will probably go to prison (was previously on remand and didn't cope well), so his delusional thoughts centre around that he thinks police are out to get him, that prison officers want him to commit suicide and the Judge sentencing him wants his death certificate and how he feels he has to do this. Not long ago he went missing in a forest and police had to search for him.
Upon hearing his symptoms, would the hospital be more likely than not to admit/section him? I think he could really do with it, and we're hoping that when the judge learns of this she will impose a Hospital Order, rather than a prison term.

I started taking mirtazapine 15mg mid November 2024. IMO it's a wonderful antidepressant. I've tried many ssris and none have worked. 

I was still using (drugs) when I was started on the mirt & extremely low but they worked for depression & sleep. I got clean 6/12/25. Mirt continued to work brilliantly, though no longer for sleep, I take a zopiclone at night too. Yes, I've put weight on but that's only because I have a normal appetite now. Previously I was living off sugar.

Anyway, for the last 4 weeks my mood has become more depressed/hopeless/bored/unmotivated. 

I have arranged a docs appointment next week to see if I should increase the mirt. (Bern on 15mg for 3 months before mood change). 

But there are other factors that could be affected my mood:
1. My autistic daughter is awake all night and disturbing my sleep
2. I'm addicted to a poker game app, which is also disturbing my sleep and delaying my morning habits
3. I've nothing going on in the day, since I completed an online college course about 4 weeks ago, so even going out for a walk (which I love), I just can't be bothered

So fast forward a couple years I’d be about 8 at this time and because my dad left so early I had grown up thinking he died. That’s until my brother (who I will call “jack” as I am not comfortable sharing his real name) came into my room and told me our dad had just messaged him. 

And from then on we started seeing my dad again, but after a year or two of being a real father he stopped putting the effort in and this really changed jack a lot he started to be really abusive towards my mum and hit me and her, he used to smash windows, threaten to kill us all including himself , I’ll never forget walking home from school terrified that I’m gonna see  my mum dead when I open the door. I genuinely believe it will stay with me forever.

I do want to add my brother is a total tally different person now and is the complete opposite of how he used to be. The problem is the damage has already been done and I don’t know if I can ever forgive him, not to mention all the other thoughts running round my head about why my father doesn’t love me.

I have been experiencing anxiety due to my work from a long time. However in recent times it has started to manifest physically. I feel my heart racing, there is a constant knot in my throat. I loose my appetite and eat less. I am literally unable to swallow food if I'm worrying about something.

For background on me- I am working as a software developer for a bank. It is a demanding role with responsibilities. I come from a humble background and in the beginning of my career had a lot of debt. My family didn't own a home. I did not feel the pressure so much as things could not be worse than it was.
Fast forward I have now married and have a baby. I have a mortgage on my home which will take 5 more years to pay off. 
I feel more prone to failure now as I have a lot to lose. Even the slightest pressure or dealine in work makes me anxious and I constantly worry if I will be able to make it on time. This makes to avoid facing difficult calls or conversations and not do stuff on time. In short I am making my own situation worse.
Another thing is I am unable to refuse work if I am not able to accommodate it. I can't say no and this leads to more problems and pressure.
I have considered changing jobs but I understand that wherever I go the same problem might continue.

MentalHealthSupport,"From around the age of five I was involved in team sports starting with football (soccer). At the time I remember not really knowing what football was and as a result I was useless playing for a team of boys older than me. I was the player that played everywhere but only when someone better than me was not able to play. That didn’t really matter to me apparently, I was happy to stay and a year later when a team was formed for my age group I joined that. I stayed with this team for almost ten years until we fell apart after our second manager had abandoned us due to our (the teams) attitude problems. Over these ten years I fell in love with the sport. Following teams, playing with my club, playing on the streets and watching matches with my dad. It wasn’t an obsession but it was probably the thing that I spent most of my time outside of school doing. Over this time my ability developed as well becoming a regular first team starter before, at the age of around 11, I captained the team for the first time, a position I held for the rest of my playing years. The team I played for was just a local side that shared one pitch for all age groups. At the age of 12 I started at a new school where rugby was a main sport. So to fit in and make friends I tried out for rugby. Again, I was not the best player to start as many other boys had been playing rugby while I was playing football. But after two years on the second team I eventually started making it onto the bench for the first team before finally finding a starting birth.  After this I continued to play for the first team until the age of 18 when I finished school. It was in these years when I was probably at my most sport obsessed playing for both teams. I had 1 football training session and a match once a week, but for rugby a lot more. A minimum of 3 sometimes 4 pitch training sessions per week, 3 strength and conditioning sessions before school in the morning and 1 match a week. I would also often do one more additional gym session on Friday because I wanted to get bigger for rugby. It was a lot of time commitment but I was more than happy and really felt like this is what I had to do to win, but we never won. In football my team was never the best we played in the weaker divisions, usually 4-6 steps from the top division and had some success. We often managed to find ourselves winning games and playing what we thought was nice football with some good players. But we never managed to go all the way. The culmination of this was a season in which we wrestled over the title all year long to eventually lose out by a couple of points, while simultaneously making it to the cup final which we lost 2-0. This was a real turning point as well lost our first manager who wed had for nearly 10 years. After this the team never performed again eventually ending up at the bottom of the bottom division with 2 points all season before we were fully disbanded. In rugby I played with my school so the main two focus competitions are the junior and senior cups. Our school played in the second tier and it was very common for us to be on the receiving end of a spanking. In the junior cups we made it to the semi-final before losing. I was lucky to play in two of the senior competitions but both times we were knocked out after two rounds. There was annual league and playe competitions as well. We reached multiple finals and semi-finals for these but fell short at every opportunity even when we were the favourites. After I had left school and my football team was dispanded I went to college. I tried out for the football (soccer) team at my college taking a trial. Our college is not famous for football and does not have a strong team, despite this i was not invited to the team following my trial. Since this time I have not returned to team sports and have graduated college. Sports remain a large part of my identity as I still follow both rugby and football. Looking back I feel like I was never really good at any sports, only ever good enough to make weak teams and never starring for these teams. I feel like a bottom 1% athlete. Now in my life as an adult I know that not everything is perfect. I have developed a tendency to blame myself for other people’s issues. I struggle to feel confident independently. I don’t feel like as a person I am good enough and am afraid I am dissapointing those around me. I don’t feel deserving of relationships, I don’t feel like im capable of giving partners and friends the things they need. I reject praise and find it difficult to believe when people say nice things about me. I struggle to accept achievements and have a tendency to downplay them and focus on what I didn’t achieve. I find generally that I am unhappy and I am trying to address this feeling of self-inadequacy. In doing this I have begun to focus on my time playing sports. Has my lack of tangible accomplishments in sports resulted in some sort of loser mentality, and has this been incorporated into my belief around my whole self and not just my sporting ability?

MentalHealthSupport,"For context I’m 16M (17 in a few months), I live in a relatively small area in a household with my parents ~40-ish each. I school online, there’s public schooling but I have bad memories there— and have a teacher who terrified me with how I was treated; who didn’t respect boundaries. 

I have two siblings, grown up both failed to graduate and moved out and away. I’m currently a Junior, and I’m many credits behind while also on the brink of failing and getting kicked out of school.

If I get kicked out, I don’t have other options and will be put back into public schooling. I have failed geometry class no matter how hard I try, three times— that’s all they offer. The only teacher who teaches it is a teacher who would force me into hugs and scream at us about how we made her life horrible, and how dumb we were. 

When I was 14, freshman year I tried to commit by OD. I was in the locker room when I freaked out, overhearing the room spinning and admitted. I was taken out by ambulance.

Sophomore year, still there twice I was admitted to Inpatient once by choice once not by. The school failed to be able to help me, gave me a 504 and didn’t follow it at all. I transferred to online, and have since been diagnosed with Autism, and ADHD ontop of my previous Depression + Anxiety duo.

I hate schooling, never want to do it never see the point. I was an overachiever as a kid, peaked in 5th grade. Always in gifted lessons, always tested out of classes was smart it all came easily, all I was ever talked about for was being smart. I didn’t have time to even think about who I was.

As I went through middle school I realized I didn’t know who I was, I had no interests I had nothing that I really did for me. It scared me so fucking much. And into high school, finally I’ve figured out some of myself as a person. I love writing, I like drawing I am a fan of gaming I want to grow up to do art or do coding. I want to leave the country, I was so happy. But in the process I’ve less and less wanted to do school because I never got to be myself, I’m catching up on years of never being allowed to be a kid. 

I was always the mature and the smart one, I always talked with adults I never got to find anything fun because I was too old for it. Because I’m now 50 assignments behind, struggling to stay afloat it’s all my parents care about. They only ever talk to me about that. I could ask them what I really like, about anything that I really care about and they wouldn’t know a thing. I tell them about it all the time but they always tell me the same ‘it’s good I could never do that’ or ‘I don’t understand’ when I try to help them to. 

Any time, any time I’m ever proud of myself anything I’ve done. I finished a chapter in my book, I finished an art piece I’m really proud of? I never get any recognition, it’s silence or being scolded. Or ‘that’s cool anyways you need to do school.’ I’ve done so much, I was so proud of myself but again all I’m ever recognized for is school. I hate it so much in my core I can’t even finish a dumb assignment because my head just shuts off and won’t process. Every thought I have when I’m not able to keep myself distracted is about being a failure, about ending up back in that school back trying to end it all. The hospital tried to help, my parents sat down and said they’d do everything they said but never really did any of it. 

I don’t have a future, I can’t see one at all no matter how much I try and I scares the shit out of me. I can never see them being proud of me for something I’m happy of myself for. I work a job, to be responsible but even that doesn’t make them proud. Is it really that hard for them to really try to listen to what I like, to see me as their kid or to appreciate me for just existing? I know my siblings failed, I know you want the best for me but mentally I can’t see myself living to 18. When they help me? They never did, they just tell me to pull myself together and fix myself. I just want to be somebody who isn’t a smart 5th grader who is full of potential I don’t live up to, and just lets everyone down. I don’t want to be turning to things bad for me to find any form of silence in my head and to forget about everything just so I can feel proud of what I’ve done. Because it feels like I have some depressed 20 year old who never made it to college, is stuck back in school and never made it running my head. 

Is it wrong of me? Wrong to want them to be proud of the little sum I’ve made myself into in this world? Have I just never been able to have any ‘work ethic’ and are lazy for never wanting to get out of bed, to sleep all day and just not exist at all? To wake up every morning and question if I should’ve even let myself wake up from last night knowing the first thing they’ll say to me every morning is how I’m failing and need to fix myself?",Just need general support (Vent-ish?),1742285297.0,1jdzz9s

MentalHealthSupport,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me. And it’s a loop.",When does poor mental and physical health symptoms an excuse or a reason?,1742202636.0,1jd8du2

MentalHealthSupport,"Writing this is a way to make sense of it all. Up until 2 years ago, I had it all - at least on paper. I was marrried, and despite difficulties it was a good marriage and partnership. I had two lovely kids. I had a well-paid job. We lived in a home we owned in a good part of town.

For both my wife and I, it had been a struggle to get there. We both had a rough childhood (mine included things like emotional abuse, neglect, poverty, homelessness, …), but we both had worked on ourselves in therapy and whatnot. We were in our mid-thirties when we met, and both have done our own homework. I didn’t have a lot of friends, because I’ve been in survival mode for so long.

Two years ago, everything changed, when I got sick with an infection of my brain. A GP sent me home twice before the ER finally diagnosed me and started treatment. It was a close call, but I survived. Albeit with a brain injury. I had trouble walking, talking, concentrating, memory loss, got overwhelmed quickly. What followed was a rough period of rehabilitation. Despite what the neurologists expected, I started to improve. Slowly, but various disabilities remained.

This also put a strain on our marriage and family life. One of my strengths always was my mental capacity, and my drive/energy. And that was gone. About six months in, my wife warned me: if I didn’t improve more, she’d leave me, putting extra pressure on me to recover.

Since I couldn’t work during rehabilitation, she worked more, and started her own business. Since then it has evolved into a situation where she is always working, and I do everything at home, and with the kids. It’s basically a traditional house-wife situation, but with flipped gender roles. I do help her with her business quite a bit, anything from doing the admin to building her website etc.
Both are unhappy with this, and both are resentful. We both retreat to our childhood coping skills. For her: fighting and battling, for me retreating.

In the meantime, I get permanent disabilities, and lose my old job. This means that I am allowed to work, but the experts believe I will never be able to, again. I however believe I can still do some things, but since I am so tied up in housework and supporting my wife, there’s no room to even try to do so.

So at this point, I have already lost my health, my freedom, my job. And yesterday, after a big fight, my wife told me she wanted a divorce. Because I’ve changed so much, and how I didn’t see and respect all that she is doing. This, plus a lot of name-calling. It wasn’t the first big fight, but this was different.

Now: she would like to stay in our home with the children, so things change as little as possible for them. Since the kids are the most important, I agree. I cannot pay the mortgage by myself anymore (while she can) so that makes sense. However, that also means that I don’t have a place to live. I cannot afford to buy anything, will not geg a mortgage because of my disabilities, and the rental market in our city is next to impossible. 

In all likelyhood, I will need to live in my car for a while. The little money I geg from my disabilities goes to my wife and kids, as alimony. Since I have no place to live, I will not be able to see my children anymore. 

I’ve lost it all and I don’t know how to get out of this mess anymore. It pains me that my disability brought me here, and blocks all means I had in the past to get out of something like this. I have nowhere to turn, no support system. I am failing at life.",Rock bottom,1742206372.0,1jd98a1

MentalHealthSupport,"Yesterday I was overwhelmed at work. My responsibilities have shifted from 1 position (dish washing at restaurant) to 2, (bussing tables as well) so there are many more rules to follow. I was pushing through brain fog anyways.
These tables were very conveniently set up for cleaning. I got the idea in my head that somebody was instructed to make my job easier for me, because it was the first time I saw them set up in this way. I was so humiliated at the thought of being accommodated for that I became emotional, and felt unsafe, felt the need to hide from humanity. It is my responsibility to understand my needs and communicate them, not make other people guess.
(I later told a manager and it was explained to me that this table set-up was company policy, not targeted.) 
For some reason, I ""hid"", by sitting in a chair, curling up and crying, hoping it would help my mood, on the front patio, not in the back. This was in clear view of lots of customers, and I got a bit self conscious coming back inside. But, now knowing I was reading too much into a situation, I was laughing this off. Not bothered anymore, just a weird little thing that happened! 
When I got home, I checked my schedule, and it has been changed significantly. I only work 3 days this week instead of my usual 5. 
I was quick to take this as evidence that I screwed up, I've embarrassed my management. I think they are shooting themselves in the foot by refusing to get rid of me. I've been here for months and my schedule has not been adjusted this dramatically before. 
Now my dad's urging me to find a new job because this is not safe! at this rate, we will NOT be able to make rent. 
So now I am rather bothered by the incident again.
What do I do with my feelings of upset? Motivation to do better? the threat of losing everything doesn't motivate me, so I'm not sure what I have. I feel that all I can do is watch everything get worse around me.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello, I am a 20 year old woman who still lives at home. I live with my mom and my grandma, who I call my parents because it's just easier to do so. My father was never really in the picture.  
Since I was a child, my family has been very christian and has done things such as lighting a candle for someone who is sick, to help them spiritually or something.  
I'm not sure how or when it started but I remember for a while that my parents would also blame other distant family members for sickness or disease.

When I was about 6-9 years old, I don't remember how old really was, my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

She is now back home and better than before but also not really?  
My grandma and my mom have been feeding into each other's delusions since we moved into the house we currently live in.  
It was okay for a while, just still believing that other's are responsible for our misfortune and some protection charms here and there but then one day, my mother got herself some sort of old audio recorder and set it up in our hallway while we were all outside. When we got back, she started screaming about people having broken in into our house because of what she heard on the recorder. The sound on it was muffled and honestly sounded like it came from upstairs but I couldn't convince her of that.

Since that day, both of my parents are under the firm believe that people are breaking into our house while we are gone. My mother even gets mad at me when I nap when they are gone because she thinks in that time frame of me napping someone already broke in and did something.  
What do these people do when they break in? Put curses on things apparently.

Last year or maybe a bit later, my parents have started asking entities that they believe they are in contact with if things are 'ruined' or not. They grab a pendulum and ask those entities with that. If whatever they are asking about is 'ruined', they throw it away.  
They threw away a bunch of my childhood items, which I kept as memories away last year because of this. It made me terribly upset but they won't listen to me because they think they are protecting me with this. It makes so furious and so helpless.

They also believe that when they are out in a store or something, certain people are there that want to them harm, cursing them or something. It's paranoia inducing to keep seeing your parent look around like crazy in a store because stranger looked at them wrong.  
This Sunday, I have caught myself getting uneasy because a stranger kept staring at me, also for a second getting worried about something like that and that now makes me so upset.

Another thing is that both of them talk to people in their head. My grandma has full on arguments with herself in the living room because she is getting telepathic messages from my mom's ex boyfriend or she can't hear certain things because she is scared that someone else will hear.

I don't have my own room to retreat into to get away from all of this, I always hear all of this and it's so upsetting when I think about it because of how normalized it is for me. My grandma calls my aunt and tells her to watch out because my uncles wife might've cursed her child or something and my aunt seems to take it seriously.

My parents call me a ''Non-believer'' when I get upset and tell me that I'll understand in the future.  
I am terrified of believing them, I do not want to live as paranoid and sheltered as they do.  
Right now, I am trying to move up with all I have because I cannot take living in a house without any structure like this.

I guess I posted this here to get it out and to see if I'm not crazy, that this truly not normal and that I'm not overreacting with how upset I get at all of this.",My family might be experiencing psychosis and I do not know how to deal with it,1742248445.0,1jdoz50

MentalHealthSupport,"Someone I deeply care about has been struggling for a while now. Since around Christmas, they’ve been feeling really overwhelmed, stuck and emotionally drained. They described it as their world falling apart, and they’re just trying to keep things together without any solid coping mechanism. They’ve tried different small coping methods like writing, resting, and giving themselves space, but nothing seems to be helping, if anything, they just get more frustrated and end up circling around sh. They don't do it quite often but when things get really awful, they tend to do so. They recently told me they feel like they’ve given up on themselves and that there is no hope to help them. When we're together in person, they feel a little better, but obviously, I can’t be there 24/7. I’ve been doing my best to be a steady presence for them — just showing up, checking in, and reminding them they’re not alone — but I feel like it’s not helping enough. I don’t want them to feel like they have to “fix” everything right now. I just want to help them feel a little lighter, like their day is worth waking up for.

MentalHealthSupport,I (18m) have been struggling with procrastination ever since I was a kid. I know that it’s bad and I have honestly and truly tried a lot of things to manage it and even came to terms with it never going away but as time goes on I can only feel it get worse and worse. My mother who is a single parent has given everything for me to be a good man and all for me to just turn out like this feels as if I’m just spitting in her face. I can’t even look at her sometimes knowing that I could and can be better but it feels like I don’t even try anymore after trying again and again but never getting anywhere. It came to a point where I felt disconnected from everything and was just riding along life as if it were a game. Nowadays I don’t feel like that though I still haven’t fixed this big issue. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t physically feel motivated or disciplined enough to do anything because I never see the point of doing anything even though I know that everyone around me is cheering me on it just doesn’t reach my heart and soul for some reason and I feel as if I have given up in the inside.

MentalHealthSupport,"Im 23 male. i was a really smart kid all my life up until high school (age 17) in malaysia there’s a huge exam that decides which university you’ll be able to go to. i scored really well and got straight A’s. i have never not gotten straight A’s in any important exam. i was also active in co curriculum in high shcool and so with good results and my achievements in co curriculum activities in high school, i was able to secure a scholarship to study in the UK.

When i got to the UK, i changed. I wasnt a good student who studies well, scores well and my attendance was really bad. This kept going for 3 years (2024 summer). After failing to maintain a good result, i had to go back to Malaysia as my sponsor asked me to. Ever since that my relationship with my father has become so much worse.

While i was in the UK, i found a girlfriend (malaysian, not english) who i love very much. As i was doing worse and worse with my studies, it affected my relationship as i was under so much stress. When i had to come back to Malaysia because my sponsor asked me to, she started to become the least of my priorities. I was extremely occupied with dealing with my Sponsor and parents and i was very emotionally and physically exhausted but more so emotionally. I felt like ive extremely disappointed my parents and i felt worthless as a son. I wasnt available for my partner and i ended up ghosting her as i couldnt at all bring myself to be there for her. I was always exhausted from dealing with my sponsor and my parents. The whole time i ghosted her, the only thing that kept me going was the fact that i wanted to get things in my life back together before i go back to her because i became a very angry person whenever i was with her while this all was going on and i dont want that for her. she doesnt deserve to deal with an angry man. I am aware that my mistake of not communicating this to her was a big one but i couldnt bring myself to reach out to her as things were still messy and hectic on my end. in my head that seems like itll just slow down my progress which will delay me getting back on my feet and being able to be with her again.

3 months later, things are looking much better as i was getting full attendance for all my subjects in university, my results are improving so much more and i am scoring really well in my exams. I also got approved by my sponsor to continue my studies in Malaysia and things were looking to go well and I have finally managed to get my life back together. I decided to reach out to her because ive changed from being a loser and have changed things in my life for the better. But shes already moved on, and shes already starting to see someone else. I have never felt so hopeless in my life. I feel like the effort and work i put in the past 3/4 months have been completely useless.

My relationship with my dad is also not getting any better as he doesnt feel like ive changed. this makes me feel even more unseen and im really at the point of quitting and feeling like theres no point in trying anymore. it just feels like nothing is worth the effort as the effort ends up being unseen and worthless.

Im sorry this is a very long post but i feel extremely unseen and this feels like the only way of getting things out of my chest and hopefully being seen by someone, even if theyre online.",My effort to change feel useless and i feel so hopeless and unseen,1742267802.0,1jdvrfr
MentalHealthSupport,"I’ve just been experiencing so much things that I don’t even understand what they mean and I just need someone to talk to. I need someone to help me make sense of it all.

MentalHealthSupport,"I haven’t felt at peace for the last 2 years

Hello! I am just here to vent and maybe seek an answer to what I am experiencing. 

I am 19 and in my first year of university. For the last two years I feel like I haven’t felt at peace with myself. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed as I have constant mood changes. I used to have mood swings pretty often but for the past half a year they started happening daily. There are times when my mood changes drastically several times a day without a specific reason. The feelings are usually pretty extreme. I am either on cloud 9 or feel like I want to end it all. These mood swings are also noticeable as my roommate pointed them out. 

I feel like I’m always craving a feeling, like I’m always waiting for something but I don’t know what. I have no interest in relationships anymore due to a lot of heart break in the past, so it’s not even about connection.

I feel like being away from home also impacts my mood significantly. The only thing that I feel truly made me feel better was driving around my city. Speeding made me feel pretty good, whenever I was alone of course. The rush of adrenaline was satisfying. But now I don’t have that anymore, as my car is at home. 

I’ve had problems with addiction as well. Besides smoking, I used to find my solace in pot until I started to rely on it too much whenever I had problems. I was able to quit a year ago, but found myself relying on alcohol after that. I used to drink almost every day which I feel made me hate myself more due to an alcohol addiction in one of my family members. After an incident when I self harmed when I got too drunk I tried to drink less which has worked so far. 

I feel like I have no one to talk to about all of this as I know everyone has their own issues. I don’t want to be a burden to the people around me. I do journaling which does help in the moment. 

I am afraid everything I do is in vein. I feel sick with myself as I am overwhelmed by stress and pretty much everything. I’m sorry for rambling so much but thank you for reading.

MentalHealthSupport,"Sorry for the long read and any other issues, I don't post much.

I'm currently pregnant (29 weeks)with my second son, and I'm having multiple complications. Long story short, I came to visit my mom from across the country for the holidays (Christmas 2024) with my 2 year old son. My partner stayed behind because of work reasons, as my mom convinced me to come stay with her indefinitely so she can help with my son and the pregnancy. Or should I say she cried every day that I 'took away her grandson away' until I felt so guilty I agreed to come.

I arrived a few days before my birthday, and I obviously wasn't interested in partying as I was already pregnant. I just wanted to have a get together with family since it was so close to Christmas and I did miss my extended family, and my mom said we would have a dinner party. There was no get together, just her and my stepdad, me and my son. Fine. I get it, I'm not a child and I'm used to people being busy around my birthday, no big deal. 

My stepdad made a meal that I like, and once it was ready my mom grabbed a plate and sat there eating while I got my son ready for dinner. She basically served herself and started eating before anyone else sat down, and when I asked if she was going to wait for us to eat she threw her fork on her plate and rolled her eyes. I started crying and told her I just wanted to eat as a family for my birthday. She just shook her head, annoyed, and scoffed and sighed until we sat down with our plates. It's been downhill from there.

On Christmas Day me and my stepdad woke up mid morning and started Christmas dinner. I always liked cooking and my stepdad once made the turkey upside down so I decided to help him out a bit. We started the turkey and the ham, and started peeling potatoes and prepping other veggies, all while my mom and hungover cousin slept. 1pm rolls around, then 2pm, and my cousin woke up and hopped in the shower but my mom was still in her room. From what I could tell she was watching TV.

She didn't come out until 4:30pm, bundled up in her bathrobe. She didn't wish us Merry Christmas, she didn't even talk to anyone just went straight into the living room to wait for everything to be ready. Me, my stepdad and my cousin served everything into dishes and carved the meats and set the table up. A few other family members arrived and she finally started talking and came to sit down. I didn't say anything but I was definitely annoyed that she didn't lift a finger or even ask if anything needed to be done. She wanted to be served like royalty or something.

The rest of the holidays were just me hanging out with my son since all she wanted to do was drink with my cousin. I didn't mind, but I wasn't about to sit around with them while they smoked and drank (outside on the porch, as long as it wasn't in front of my son I had zero problem). On New Year's I went to bed around 8pm. 

After the holidays I went to see my OB that delivered my son, I just wanted her opinion and a check-up to make sure my pregnancy was going well. Turns out it was not. I had caught a cold over the holidays and was having bad coughing fits and everytime this happened I was apparently losing amniotic fluid. Initial ultrasounds showed that my unborn son only had one tiny kidney and was much less active than he should have been. My OB immediately sent me to specialists and reccomended I stay put until we figure out what was going on with the baby.

The specialists put me on bedrest and set up tons of appointments and also in home visits with a nurse twice a week. I was scared, I still am. The doctors told me I'm at risk for premature labor because I have a micro rupture and are preparing me mentally in case I have a preemie baby. I thought, okay, my mom will help me get through this since, you know, she's my mom. I was dead wrong.

I told my mom what the doctors told me, the risks and that they don't want me doing anything that could cause my water to break, and she didn't really say anything. She more or less continued her routine, which is laying in bed all day until 4pm sometimes, then going out onto the porch to drink and smoke and get high (she smokes tons of pot). Sometimes she lays in bed for 3-4 days at a time. She has my stepdad feed her dinner and drinks in bed and doesn't even come out to use the bathroom. I don't even see her shower. 

I know it's probably depression but I'm thousands of miles away from my partner and I'm scared and hormonal so I confronted her. It did not go well. I asked her why she doesn't even say hello to me or good morning when she does get up (but she talks to my son and acts like I don't exist), or why she doesn't care about me or the baby's health, and she blew up at me and asked me why I didn't care about my dead brother. 

My older brother died 7 days before my son was born in 2022 after fighting stomach cancer for 18 months. It was a difficult time for me and I did my best to balance grief and joy, and I ultimately named my son after my brother in his honor.

My brother was no contact with my mom because of her own actions and she's since decided it was somehow my fault. She blamed me for his death and for not being able to go to his funeral (my SIL, his wife, forbade it), and just started attacking me. She called me stupid for not getting a post-secondary education, she made fun of me and laughed at me and told me to 'go to a fucking shelter'. I was crying and upset and called my stepdad to talk to her, and she just laughed even more and said there was no point running to him because he does whatever she tells him to do. She cracked open a beer as she said all of this.

I was shaking and crying and just took my son into the guest room. I was terrified they would throw us out and basically hid in the room until the next morning. My son and I woke up, I made him breakfast, and my mom actually emerged from her room shortly after. She tried to baby talk my son while he ate and I asked her to stop. She rolled her eyes and sighed at me, but left my son alone. After getting dressed and chainsmoking some cigarettes she left the house without a word.

A few hours later she came back, I watched her pull into the driveway with a car following hers, and I just knew. She had gone to the local family services office and told them a bunch of lies and brought a social worker back with her to do a wellness check. My mom came into the house and slammed the door behind her and kicked some sort of empty box across the living room while the social worker was coming up the walkway. My mom then stormed through the house and went out on the back porch for a cigarette slamming the back door. 

The social worker knocked before coming in, awkwardly came into the living room and stood there looking confused. She introduced herself and I introduced myself and I kind of just politely smiled and told her I already knew what was going on, as this was the second time my mom called cps on me. I forgot to mention the reason why I moved across the country in the first place is because she tried to have my son taken away when he was 3 months old. Anyway, I was talking with the social worker explaining my sittuation and when I told her I'm pregnant she looked shocked. Apparently my mom didn't tell her that part.

I told her I'm having complications and the baby has medical issues and I'm supposed to be on bedrest. The whole time my son was playing with me, sitting on my lap, dancing around, just being a 2 year old. My mom was glaring at us through the back door. I told the social worker I've never slapped my kid, which is what my mom said,  I don't even spank him. I don't scream or yell at him, he's clean and well fed and happy. I told him they can examine him if they want, he had a doctor's appointment literally a few days before and they could talk to the doctor if they wanted to. The social worker said from what she could see none of that would be nessecary.

My mom came barging back in the house in a cloud of smoke and completely lost it. She was yelling at me and literally pointing her finger at me, she told the social worker not to let me manipulate her and I was lying, ect. She was complaining to the social worker that I just sit and watch TV, she was talking about my brother, she was complaining that I don't allow her to play with my son. The social worker was extra confused and asked me again if I was on bedrest, then (as politely as she could) asked my mom what she wanted me to do? The worker also told my mom if I don't want her talking to my son then she has to respect that, her house or not.

The social worker then said this doesn't look like a case of child abuse on my part, it was more of a housing issue on my mom's part, and asked my mom if she was planning on throwing us out. My mom got even more mad and asked the worker how she knew I was telling the truth, and I reminded my mom that the social worker does this sort of thing for a living and can probably tell because it's her freaking job. My mom, while pointing her finger at me the entire time, backed up to the back door while screaming at me that I can stay if I stop slapping my son around. My son was starting to whine and get scared at this point and I was crying too and he ran across the room and jumped into my arms.

My mom slammed the door, again, and lit another cigarette while talking to herself. The social worker looked stunned. She spoke to me super calm and told me to calm myself down, she said she was sorry for what I'm going through and if I needed her to call directly. She gave me her number and told me to avoid anymore conflict, and if my mom continued to fight with me or scare my son to call the cops. It was a Friday, and she told me she was on call that weekend so she would know if I called the police, and that she would be back on Monday to check on us.

Once again I took my son to hide in the guest room. I fed him dinner in the room and eventually we went to sleep. We woke up as usual the next morning for breakfast, and the porch was a complete disaster. My mom and my stepdad drank a couple of cases of beer and went through several jars of pot (it's legal here) and the ashtray was overflowing with butts. There were ashes and weed pipes and empty beer cans all over, and her car keys were also sitting there in the mess. I took a video and some pictures, just in case.

I messaged some friends I had left in the area, asking them if they could put me and my son up for a few days, but nobody has room, which I get because they all have children and their own families. I don't want to go to a shelter because I think my son has been through enough. My mom was in and out of shelters with me and I saw some shit, I don't want to put my son through that. My mother in law was willing to put us up in a hotel for a few days if we really needed but that's just a band-aid. I decided to ride the storm and see what happened. If my mom continued to act crazy, I would call the cops and go to a hotel. If not, I would tough things out. I can't fly back home because of the baby, I'm pretty much stuck here.

I asked my stepdad if I could sit in the living room and watch TV, he said it wasn't a problem. My mom stayed in her room the entire weekend, I didn't see her once. On Monday she got up early and got dressed and sat outside chainsmoking, waiting for the social worker. At around 2pm I ended up calling family services myself and I was told the worker was dealing with an emergency sittuation. An actual child in need. We ended up setting up a meeting for the next morning at 9am.

The worker showed up the next day, right on time. My mom was still in bed, as per usual. The worker and I talked while my son finished up breakfast, I told her my mom refused to speak to me and was spending her time in her room. She asked if I would like counselling and I said yes, I also asked if she could reccomend my mom also go to family counselling with me. She said she would, and she would contact my mom seeing as she was sleeping, then she left. My mom woke up at 2pm and went right to the porch and just sat there smoking until I went to bed.

This all happened about 6 weeks ago. She had my stepdad take a day off work to meet with the social worker because he was going to lie for my mom and say he saw me hit my son. The social worker said we were past that point and there's no evidence of abuse besides their word against mine and my son's doctor, she basically said she's not going to entertain their claims any further without actual evidence. She offered my mom the counselling and my mom refused. 

I've been in and out of the hospital for baby appointments since then, ultrasounds and labs and examinations and meeting with specialists. My nurse comes twice a week to check the baby's movement and heartbeat. Last week I was bleeding and I ended up taking an ambulance to the hospital. It ended up being a false alarm and they released me and my mom left me sitting there for an hour so she could blow dry her hair and put on make-up (the hospital is about a 20min drive away). I'm just so goddam tired.

My mom refuses to apologize, she refuses to acknowledge what she did, she just acts like nothing happened. It sucks so much because I can't afford a sitter and everytime I have an appointment I either have to leave my son with her or she has to drive me. I'm afraid she's going to kidnap my son, I'm afraid she's going to hurt us or throw us out. I'm so scared of what's going to happen when I eventually go into labor, I can't take my son with me I have to leave him with my mom. I'm so worried she won't feed him or change his diaper. Every time I do leave him with her she just puts the TV on full blast and overfeeds him, and the other day when I came back he had a horrible diaper rash.

My bf has work commitments and was planning on flying here for my due date but at this point that could be any time. We've pretty much decided that he'll come get us about a month after the baby is born because that's when the doctors said it'll be safe to fly again. IF the baby doesn't end up in the NICU.

I'm so depressed right now, I feel so alone and so helpless. I want to go home but I can't, I need help with my son sometimes but there's nobody around to just feed him lunch or watch him for 10mins so I can take a freaking shower. I feel so bad for my son because some days I'm just so exhausted I just stick him in front of his tablet. I have nobody to talk to, I can't keep burdening my friends with my drama, I can feel their eyes glazing over, so I just don't. I don't ask for help because I'm not close with my friends like I used to be, I moved away 2 years ago and the investment just isn't there anymore.

Today was hard, my mom and stepdad are having a nice lazy day, lounging in bed. They don't ask me if I need anything or how I'm feeling. They just act like I don't exist. I'm so tired, I wish I could rest and lay in bed all day but I can't, my son needs me. I don't even have clean clothes. I'm having so much trouble taking care of myself and my son, some days I just cry. I'm so scared of trying to recover from child birth in this environment, I know I won't be able to take care of myself and my son and a newborn. My son can't wait until 4pm to eat or have his diaper changed. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for posting here. Maybe I just needed to have a good vent and I'll find the strength to get through this. Everyone says I'll be home with my babies before I know it, I just feel like it's so far away and impossible.

Since i was a kid i have been struggling with depression and self isolation and feel like things will never be okay again. After i passed 10th class i kinda fell off really hard, wasnt able to continue with anything productive because of several burnouts. Over a span of 3 years i tried to get back into school two times but i could never do more than a few weeks before my mind collapsed on me again. Now i sit at home all day every day. Mostly sleeping and rotting. My only nearby friends have started to feel less like friends and home. Not sure why that is but they dont even text me anymore, dont want to hop on games, anything. Every conversation feels forced and awkward. Problem is every other ""friend"" I have is not from my area, all in differend countries and timezones. But even they show any real interest in me at all. I dont know what i am doing wrong but i feel like im the problem. 

Yea I have been going to a therapist for a long time now aswell but it doesnt really help me either. I dont have the energy to follow through with things we discuss there. I just feel lost and lonely all the time. Unable to do anything with myself and scared that i will never make it to something.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hey everyone,

I'm using a burner account because this is a pretty personal story, but I wanted to hear how others have dealt with similar situations.

I (M, 21) have been in a deep emotional slump lately. I struggle to get out of bed in the morning, can’t sleep at night, and have no mental or physical energy to do anything during the day.

This all started after a really tough six months. A few months ago, I cut ties with my father (M, 53) after my parents separated. But if I’m being honest, I had already made that decision when I was around 14.

My dad was never physically abusive, and maybe he even tried to be a decent father at times, but I feel like he has been mentally abusive toward me, my younger brother, and my mom for as long as I can remember. He had only two emotional states: extremely angry or neutral. The first memory I didn’t suppress was when I was about 11, and he got into a huge argument with my grandfather (mom’s side) during Christmas. After that, there were countless similar fights, followed by attempts to fix things, but eventually, he forced my mother to choose between him or her father. She chose him, thinking it was best for me and my brother. But after all the times I sat beside her while she cried and all the moments we missed with her side of the family, I’m not sure if that was the right choice.

These big arguments kept happening almost monthly until I mentally checked out at 14. From then on, my life was just about surviving until I could move out (which, due to housing prices where I live, is currently impossible). Since I had emotionally detached myself, the fights between my dad and me became less frequent, but my brother and mom still had to deal with them a lot.

About a year and a half ago, my grandfather (mom’s side) was diagnosed with a memory disease similar to Alzheimer’s. I think this changed something in my mom. She started to realize how she was losing me and my brother because of my dad. That, along with my father cutting ties with his own parents for no real reason and the increase in fights at home, led to my mom finally deciding to separate from him last summer.

She wasn’t able to move out right away (and at first, we didn’t know who would get to stay in the house), so we had to survive another six months together. But of course, that didn’t work. Eventually, my dad and I had a huge fight, during which I told him that once my mom moved out, he shouldn’t expect to see me again. The next two months were filled with threats from him about throwing me and my mom out onto the street. Thankfully, he never had the guts to do it, but that period gave me multiple panic attacks and was mentally exhausting.

A few months ago, we finally moved into a new home, but ever since the separation, I’ve been struggling mentally. I try to attend school, but to be honest, I don’t go. Not because I don’t want to, but because I just can’t get myself to do it. The only things I manage to do are the ones that are absolutely mandatory.

And I hate this. I want my energy back. I want to finish school, build a life, regain my confidence, and maybe even have the courage to try dating again.

I’m just sad. 35/F Being struggling with depression for years. I don’t feel good about myself. Thus, I don’t look good. I’m not in a good place financially. I stay with my significant other because I don’t have  a home. But our relationship is loveless, stressful, and painful to say the least. 

I thrive at my work because I am able to give my clients all the care and kindness and well intent that I wish was poured into me. But that drains me and leaves me feeling sad,  empty and lonelier at times.  

The only thing good about me, truthfully, is despite all my shortcomings I was chosen to be mama to a beautiful young man.  

But honestly, I don’t deserve him. And if I can’t heal myself, I feel the best thing I can do for him is remove myself from this earth so he can have a real life, not grow up worrying about his sad lonely depressed mom. But I want to be the mama he deserves, I just don’t know how. . 🥺

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi there,

I'm 22M and have been wanting to post about my mental health for a while now, just to be able to get it out there. My studies, relationships and even friendships feel like they just fade into nothing after a while and i feel like I'm not making any progress at all. This last year was pretty though, all my friends are starting to get jobs and finishing their second or even third degree meanwhile I don’t have any degree, I don’t have any relationship and feel like it’s just a bad idea because I would probably mess up, I don’t have a driver’s license, no real hobbies, ... It feels like I just stopped progressing 4-5 years ago and I’m stuck while everyone’s moving on.

I've always found it very hard to find interest in something, I’m able to really like something but after a bit of time I always lose interest. I love drawing but never really do anything with it, if I force myself to make a project around it I never finish it. This is the case with almost everything I do, I can be good at something but why bother continuing if I'm never going to be great, or why bother continuing if I don't like it anymore. I always pretend that everything’s okay, I hate it when people start concerning about me because then they care and I’d probably disappoint them. I often lie so people won’t think less of me which only causes me to lie more and more until I feel so stuck I don’t know what to do anymore.

First off, I started studying for my degree about 4 years ago. I wanted to be a teacher, after my first year I had a lot of stress and was slacking quite hard. I didn't really make any friends there and always felt a bit out of place. Often times instead of studying I'd rather just stay inside and watch Youtube, play games and so on... I failed my first year but didn't really mind, I thought I could just try again the next year and so I did. My second time attempting the first year to become a teacher was in a different school, different people, different city, ... I actually met some very cool friends there which I still talk to. However that year failed as well, it took me too long to get to campus and so I fell into my old habit of being lazy, slacking off, doing nothing and only showing up if it was absolutely necessary. At the end of the year my Dad realised it too and supported me anyway, even after those 2 years, he suggested that maybe becoming a teacher wasn't for me and i should look for something else. It was at this time my first ex-girlfriend started to realise that I wasn’t really moving on in life, not only school but anything else as well. She broke up with me because of this reason, and at the start I was very mad and didn’t understand why but later I started to understand why and realised why she made this choice.

And so I started something else, another first year but this time for an art degree. I really enjoyed it in the beginning, i love drawing and that was most of the homework, just draw, great! After a while however I stopped showing up to class, stopped drawing as much, stopped showing interest and yeah... the year was though, but I only failed one class so I went with it and continued with the course the next year. So second year of my bachelor (kind off) It started out a little less great... I felt like I was very behind on everything, all my friends from before where getting there degree, started searching for work and were 'starting their life' in a way. And I was stuck, lazy and couldn't even get through a first year properly. Needless to say I felt horrible and failed my year completely again. During that year I started another relationship with someone, it started off quite well but she was graduating that year and after I failed that year I was having doubts. I thought to myself that we really couldn’t work if she started working and thinking about moving out and stuff, and I still had to find something or study again for at least 3 years. She really loved me but it felt like in the end I would only disappoint her more. We started talking less and less and eventually I broke up with her. I feel really bad for breaking her heart and really hope she moved on without too much trouble. I broke up with her for the same reason why my previous relationship didn’t work. Because I can’t progress in life. I really don’t want to drag other people down with me.

 Now what do I do, 4 years of nothing. When I told my dad that I failed I could tell that this was one of the worst things he ever heard me say. He wasn't mad but just very disappointed.

At this moment I really just wanted to give up, waste my life away with some job that nobody wants and just do that for the rest of my life. My dad however talked me out of it and told me that getting a degree of any kind is important to get a job I might enjoy. So there I go again, starting a new year, a new course. I’m now halfway through the year and I’m starting to slack off again bit by bit. It’s like I’m slipping back in a pit but I just don’t now how to stop myself. The new course I’m following is business management and while it’s interesting, I feel yet again like I totally don’t belong there. First off my classmates are all 4 years younger than me which feels pretty strange, I don’t really have any interest in making friends with them because they feel so different. Next to this the classes we have feel so difficult, often times I feel so stupid for not understanding anything while all of my classmates seem to understand it just fine. Because I was so embarrassed being a 22 who hasn’t done anything with his life I started lying a lot. I know it’s really bad but I was so embarrassed that I didn’t achieve anything I just didn’t want others to think of me as some kind of loser. So when my classmates asked why I did before this I just lied and told them I finished my art bachelor and have a driver’s license. It feels like I’m so far down that rabbit hole that I don’t even know if I should tell the truth anymore. I know it would be the right thing to do but I’ve been lying for half a year now how do I even start explaining myself.

It feels like I messed up so bad there is just no coming back anymore. I know my dad supports me a lot, but I also know deep down he’s disappointed. He has a very high job function with multiple degrees and it often feel s like I’m never going to even get close to making him proud. I really wish I could be more like him but I feel like I’ll never live up to that.

So yeah that’s basically my last 4-5 years summed up. I don’t really know what to expect from this post but I feel like I needed to put this out there in some way. Any step no matter how small is progress right? Anyways cheers and thanks for hearing me out!

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello there! I have always had trouble feeling emotions until last year when I decided to go to therapy to help me understand how I can feel feelings and not suppress them. I have had a rough childhood and had to grow up and mature at a young age. I have witnessed things between my parents and had experiences myself, but I would like to keep my family history private for now. I started to work on my self concept, physical attractiveness, health, and emotional stability since the Pandemic started and I have come a long way. I decided 2 years ago that I would try dating. I have had 2 committed relationships since then, where both lead to breakups and both of them have cheated on me. I hold myself accountable in giving my first ex another chance at coming back and staying in the relationship with my more recent ex. I would say that those relationships left a mark on me.

I did not lose any of my self-confidence, but trusting people just seems so draining that I would rather isolate. I have also had thoughts of offing myself, but I persist through this hardship regardless of how I feel. Since starting therapy last year and being more attuned to my body and emotions, I realized that I was coerced by my first ex and was SA'd. And I guess without realizing it, the trauma showed up in my relationship with my recent ex. We had intimate moments, but I had this crippling fear every time and especially when I couldn't see what he was doing. At that time, I did not know I was SA'd by my first ex, but as I understood more, the more I also realized over time. My recent ex also cheated on me, but I got gaslit instead and he used DARVO against me. He accused me of being a gold digger and ""used him for free meals."" I find it kind of funny now, but him and friends ganged up on me despite of him being in the wrong and starting the problem.

I love love and I love giving love, but I also have felt objectified by the people I should love and should have loved me. I just feel lost right now and the feelings I have suppressed for so long have started to come up. I'm taking my time alone to heal, but those thoughts of offing myself are becoming stronger. What can I do?

So my cousin (M23, from UK) is experiencing a bit of a cusis in recent times. Over past weeks and months I've noticed his highs becoming very high and euphoric and lows seeming very low and depressed. He would flip between the two every couple of days.
He doesn't have a diagnosis of anything, bar some anxiety, however, as a family we're all adamant there's more to it, so we suspect bipolar. He's aware he's unwell, but I don't think he knows just quite how severe. We discussed hospital and he would agree to go if a bed becomes available. 

So I was wondering how we could go about that. I was thinking if he contacted his GP and took it from there, explaining how we think he needs sectioned or detained in a hospital. But our fear is we won't be believed or listened to, that we'll say how we he's sometimes a danger to himself and the doctors will just sympathise but not hospitalised him. 
Does anyone know how we could go about ensuring he is hospitalised?

She has made it clear and has said she doesn't give a fuck about my life, health, education, future, and my autism is too much work and I'm too much to deal with. She said many times that she wants to give me to my dad (he wants nothing to do with us and knows she's mentally ill, he's moved on with his life and has a new family.) 

I'm also dealing with the fact that I'm trans, and it's making it so hard to even leave my bed, talk in front of anyone, or look in a mirror without breaking down. I can't tolerate being perceived as someone I'm not, and I disassociate all the time. It's affecting my daily life and is all I think about, it's causing me depression, I can't do anything about it until I'm a legal adult because of her, but even then I have no social skills, no education, no life skills, no independence, and I don't know if going to be able to live on my own or even get a job.

I finally convinced her to put me back in a school, and I'm going tommorow to it. I'm going insane being stuck with her for so long and school will help get me away from her for a while, but I'm also afraid of being put in overwhelming situations and noisy, bright, crowded places. My mum of course doesn't care about my concerns and just wants to get rid of me, so I don't know what to do. 

What am I supposed to do? I can't tolerate being around her at all because of everything she constantly does, and I'm tired of being in tears every day from the hurtful things she says to me. I have nobody I can go to, and school might be an even worse environment for me because of my autism and sensory issues, and I'll still have the weekends with her.

I just want to get away from her. My older sister, who is an adult now, ran away from my mum when she was my age and went to a different city. If I go somewhere without her permission, she'll call the police and the entire family and start swearing and shouting at me nonstop. What do I do to get away from her in the daytime? 

Please don't tell me to call social services. I already talked to the NSPCC about everything and they referred me to get a social worker, but they aren't doing much and I've said all that I can to them, and I don't have proof or recordings of her. I don't have any storage on my phone to record and the audio is horrible quality.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello, I don't know how to start them so please don't judge. So I am 16, I want help, I feel like my only option is to jump off a cliff and I want help. I don't know what to do.

So ever since I was really young I never gotten along with peers and k-3rd I was a massive bully, and around 2nd grade I was taken away from my parents and put into foster care and got put with an abusive woman along with my sister. The lady treated me horriblely but my sister was treated normally and her son was treated like royalty. Some of the things she did was, make me sleep on the bathroom floor because I kept wetting the bed, lock me up in my room when she brought friends over and let her son and my sister out, if I cry yell or scream she would yell at me, made me fold laundry and if I made the smallest mistake I was yelled at, slapped then grounded, if I let a towel touch the floor same thing (hard to keep a towel from touching the floor when the towel is twice your size). My sister was never given chores.

I stayed with that woman for about a year before I was returned to my parents with my sister. In kindergarten I made a friend, my best friend, her parents didn't like mine so they always told her to not hang out with me but for some reason she did anyways we went the best of friends in kindergarten - 2nd but in 3rd grade when my mood disorder started to mellow out we became nearly inseparable. 

Before 3rd grade I was a typical boy, but at around 3rd grade is when the signs of me wanting to be trans started, I was also diagnosed with ADHD, a mood disordered, and surprisingly depression. In 3rd grade I stopped bullying people unprovoked and only attacked them when they did something rude to me. Then in 4th grade my personality flipped entirely, I became closed off distant, I started growing out my hair and wearing this super baggy hoodie. Now that I was way less aggressive people start bullying me obviously I deserve it, obviously I didn't like that fought back a little bit but by 5th grade I completely gave up, 5th grade is also when I got REALLY REALLY bad attachment issues. The school counselors probably didn't help that because every single one I went to would leave within the year giving me really bad trust issues as well.

Now I hate myself for it now but the way I played with my friend was quite rough, but more on that later. 6th grade was when covid hit, and so in 7th grade we all were wearing masks, but by the end of 7th grade that ended but I continue to wear the mask, it made me feel super confident and now I believe it was masking my face because I was starting to mature and got a really strong jaw. Which I hated. This is the time I became really dysphoric, couldn't even look at myself without feeling sick. I believe by the end of 7th grade I was diagnosed with autism. The start of 8th grade my friend confessed to me and even though I liked her back I said no, but we stayed really good friends still completely inseparable. 

Freshman year of high school, by now almost everyone is talking crap about me behind my back, my grades slipped and I became super depressed, but I didn't see it I have no clue how, I was trying my hardest but that wasn't working anymore and so I started skipping class I couldn't deal with the bullying anymore. And then I got a boyfriend... But instead of being a loving good guy he made everything worse. He told me our relationship was a joke, then he got back together with me then he started touching me even though I didn't want that at all I told him to stop but ""since he was dating me consent is implied"" and I just took it for some reason, eventually I realized this and broke up with him, he then tried to manipulate me a couple times but I just refused, which was not a good choice.

At the end of freshman year he got my friend to leave me, now this is completely my fault but he did push it. So in freshman year my attachment issues got way worse because my friend started to become suicidal, so I always wanted to know where she was because I wanted to make sure she was safe  and I was still playing rough with her. So basically my ex got my friend to tell the school and so I was told by the vise principal that I wasn't allowed to approach my friend anymore, and told me what she said. This got me incredibly depressed and I tried to kill myself unsuccessfully. But when I returned I was still extremely depressed so much so that I couldn't even get out of bed, and when I did return I couldn't even enter the same room as her without breaking down. But thankfully for me at the very end of the year my friend basically said she missed me.

We made a deal that we'll be friends again but no physical contact, basically, then more year went then this year, it was normal untill the 2nd quarter of the school year where finally all the going up to me and I got severely depressed and couldn't go back to school. I was rotting in bed, then just last month my friend attempted suicide I was so worried, she went to a behavioral hospital but was released shortly after for some reason... But when she came back, she didn't care about me anymore, she barely talk to me. And I got a lot worse. And now I am doing online school but this is so bad, I feel useless, I feel like no matter what I do I won't be able to do anything, since like the fifth grade I wanted to be a doctor but what kind of college is going to accept someone who is doing English 9 in junior year. (I forgot to mention I feel a bunch of high school classes and now I have to do them). I miss the ACT test I won't be able to do anything, I tried to get my life back together several times this year but I can't. Now I am trying to transition and with all the transphobia around it feels like that's not going to happen for me. 

I feel horrible about feeling this way, why should I get to be depressed if people have so much worse life's, my life is perfect to someone I feel like I shouldn't be depressed, like I don't deserve this but I feel like if I can't get back together by the time I'm 18 I'm just going to jump off a cliff and hope reincarnation exists so I can be female. But I don't want to, can someone help. Please.",Please help,1742134928.0,1jcmirs

MentalHealthSupport,"Of course I don't want to accept it and struggle. I hate knowing parts of my life suck. How am I supposed to accept it and still want to improve? it doesn't work . Living the present means I just forget about worrying about my future. It doesn't work because I know if I don't do anything to make it better it won't get better. So how am I supposed to enjoy the now when there are still so many problems I haven't found the solution to or resolved? If I enjoy I am going to forget about my goals, and make more excuses to leave it to later. Yet always focusing on how my problems affect my and obsessing is making me miserable and paralysed.

Parts of my life that suck are like my health and not making a lot of money or being successful, or not being able to find a healthcare practitioner that actually listens and doesn't cost too much instead of gaslighting me and me spending tons of money to end up being disappointed and still not finding a sustainable solution.

And I feel upset of my health affecting my productivity and that affects the rate at which I will make a lot of money and be successful so I can resolve my health issues, and then the worrying on top of that makes everything worse and my progress come to a halt. Im stuck in a loop and it seems there's no way out - unless I suddenly get a ton of money or my health just resolves. How else am I supposed to catch up and be successful quickly and early.

It seems unfair... ( and when I say this people then judge me for being ""ungrateful"" or ""just weak minded"".

Then getting shamed and scolded by my parents for being stupid and thinking too much and wasting money. Then feeling hopeless and depressed and suicidal because I don't have any more money to spend to find a solution and knowing if Im gonna suffer with these chronic health issues when other people have gotten better just makes me so angry and miserable. And not even getting an answer as to why or a diagnosis of why.

Then getting shamed into thinking that ""happiness is a choice"" and my problems aren't real or valid to be upset about. and then getting told its all my fault I attracted it or I let those this or people affect me.

As it's my fault terrible situations and abusive behaviour had an effect on me. How is blaming myself for feeling upset over things that were out of my control going to make me feel motivated and empowered? If I try to ""control"" my feelings and force them to change, all I do is numb myself out with social media, or other things, and ignore , escape, distract until I feel even worse and break down.

What am I even supposed to do? Isn't this all the advice those gurus online give?

MentalHealthSupport,"The last couple of months I (27F) don’t feel like the person I used to be. And change is natural, I understand, but it feels much deeper. Part of the realisation is my boyfriend (1 year anniversary last month)–an extrovert, joyous person–and it reminded me of what I used to be.

When I was in elementary school, I was happy, had lots of friends, and quite social. Yes, I was shy back then as well, but not as shy or introverted as I feel now. The last year of elementary school, I changed schools (closer to home). I came to a class where the others were a class together for 6 years already. For them, I was an outcast, and they would surely let me know I was not welcome in their (friend) groups. If they were nice, it was just to my face, because from others I heard they were gossiping about me. 

When I went to high school, I hoped it would turn out better–but it didn’t. It got worse. I was bullied far worse than elementary school, even to the point I was pushed off my bike at the school entrance. Nothing I did could stop the bullying, those were the most horrible four years of my life. I changed high schools again in my 5th year (high school takes six years) and I got better, but not great. The damage was already done. 

I went from a happy, extroverted pre-teen (elementary school) with lots of friends to a silenced introverted teen, who hates speaking to strangers, is afraid to say or do something wrong, and lost confidence in my own self. 

Even the simple things changed me: as a kid I used to wear golden jewellery but I switched to silver because everyone in high school wore them, because I thought they would befriend me then, because I thought I looked more ‘tough’ so they would not bully me anymore. 

I tried to gain more confidence by doing karate, and while that did give me indeed more confidence, it did not solve the underlying issue. 

And maybe this has little to do with the bullying (even though it feels like that), and more with natural change by aging, but I can’t help noticing the difference. And while I don’t hate myself, I don’t love myself. I just don’t know how to fix the feeling, or how to gain more confidence, or how to be more extroverted and less introverted. 

I just want to feel like that happy, less-introverted kid I used to be, with the feeling of being an adult. I just don't know how to get there.",How do I become the person I was before I was getting bullied?,1742064746.0,1jc27eb

My roommate has had a tough year - although she is excelling at work there is a lot of drama and she isn't using her masters degree in the way she wants, she's struggled with eating and body image, and she's gone on some really awful dates (like truly terrible) and hasn't had the best of luck dating.

She is also sober due to an addiction in college and I think she's struggled not to relapse. I've had to stop her from driving to the liquor store a few times. She often starts vaping then tries to quit cold turkey which causes really bad panic attacks, one so bad she almost went to the ER.

MentalHealthSupport,"			

My memory becomes foggy and distant when I think about the first few experiences I went through back in mid 2019. I remember the feeling of paranoia, anxiety, and fear I felt, suffocation is the best term I can use to best summarize that time period. At first it came in episodes, each one getting longer and  more potent. First came this wave of extreme anxiety, my mind racing at what felt like 1,000 miles per hour, it felt like my mind began to wander on its own until eventually it would get lost in these overwhelming emotions, that looking back at it now were just my anxieties and fears that I let consume my life at that time. Although for my age(13) at that time it's not uncommon I felt that specifically during this time I was more emotional than I usually was, to the point where I began venting to others, which was something I really never did as I'm the type to want to deal with things on my own. This period of anxiety would be for a few weeks until one day it started happening, this odd feeling/perception that I began experiencing. At first I myself was having a hard time trying to rationalize to myself what I was experiencing, like something felt off but I couldn't quite point out to myself what it was, but I knew it wasn't normal. The first thing I remember that gave me cues to what was going on was my perception of time felt either extremely slow or fast, like in the blink of an eye a whole day would pass by or sometimes minutes would start to feel like hours. Then suddenly people's voices started to be altered for me, including my own voice, it was as if individuals were talking to me from across the room but were right in front of me the whole time. Simple tasks such as picking something up felt so odd because it would feel like I wasn't in my own body, like I was completely aware of the actions I was doing but felt like someone else's body physically doing it and I was just an observer. As these episodes continued to occur more frequently I began taking note that my emotions were also tainted,joy,fear and all other emotions in between felt dull, like I wasn't able to fully process/feel emotions. It's not that I was necessarily “numb” to these feelings but they felt so distant. It's like putting your hand on a window during a cold night,through your hand you have an idea how cold it is, but that wouldn't necessarily be the same as actually being outside and feeling the actual cold breeze. Although that isn't the best analogy it's the only way I,ve been to explain it.This “distant” feeling also applied to how I saw the world in the literal sense, it felt like I was watching my own life, it felt like I was attached on a Go pro spectating myself,even though I was in control in every action I did. There would be times where I would stare at my hands and think to myself “whose hands are these” or “ how is that they feel both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time”. Although I was obviously aware of “whose hands” they were, I was so disconnected from my body that at times that's how I truly felt. At times it felt like I was an unwanted visitor in someone else's body, as if I trespassed and wasn't wanted there. When this all began I remember feeling so lost, I didn't know what was going on, it felt like it was going insane, whenever I tried to express this to my family they looked at me like I was crazy as if I was just exaggerating. To be fair I don't blame them as what was going through was an uncommon thing and even myself was struggling to grasp what I was experiencing, so when I did try to put into words what I was experiencing it came out as confusing. I would then start spending time on the internet to try to get a grasp of what I had, and failed to find anything resembling anything I had. Never have I felt so lonely in my life,no one understood what I was going through, I myself was lost in my own body, and things just seemed to be getting worse. At this point I felt hopeless at the idea of this “thing” going away, but I was still hopeful to someone relating to me, all I wanted was someone to understand what I was going through. It would have made a world of difference if someone told me “ i know exactly what you going through” and mean it. I just wanted to stop feeling alone. Eventually my mother began to see how much of a toll this was taking on me and eventually took me to see a therapist. Although it took some time my therapist was able to have an idea of what I was going through, she explained to me what I was most likely experiencing was a dissociative mental disorder. This usually occurs in individuals who experience something very traumatic or when an individual exceeds their stress limit. When the body feels that it is in extreme stress it will begin detaching the mind from the body as a defense mechanism to protect the host's mental sanity. Hence why individuals who have this disorder will feel out of tune with their body, feel a “high” type sensation or how I describe it a dream like state. Although this function is helpful for the short term in high stress situations, the body will begin to forget to turn off that sensation of detachment, leaving individuals “stuck” in this state. It's thought that the body will sometimes overcompensate protecting the mind, leaving the user to feel like this for the long term or the body simply thinks you're still in “danger” . After being explained this condition it brought me relief, as finally the thing that was tormenting all that time had a name, dissociation. Although there was some sense of comfort about knowing what I had, it was still quite difficult to find any real solutions to get rid of what I had. I would see these things such as rapid eye movement therapy and other very specific treatment techniques that from what I read tend to have a very low success rate. The only advice I felt was suggested the most was to “wait it out” , the thought process was that as time passed from your initial episode that your body would eventually snap out of it because it would recognize that this peculiar mechanism wasn't needed any more to keep the body safe. At the time I accepted this notion that it would just go away, I would think to myself that this “thing” is like any other thing such as the cold, “ it would take care of itself”. So that's what I did. I waited it out, as weeks went by the episodes got longer,stronger and more frequent. I continued to have these on and off episodes until eventually one random morning I woke up with “it” a sensation stronger than any other episode to this point, it felt like I was dreaming. After that morning I did stop having “episodes”, from that morning to present day every day,hour,minute,second I,ve been in this “dream” a dream that I never woke up from. It's been 6 years. So hopeful I was for the longest time thinking to myself that “tomorrow” would be the day that I would be “normal” again until eventually I gradually started to accept that this is my new normal. Life for a while became so dull, colors became less vibrant, favorite dishes began to taste bland, and music began to feel like it lost its spark. These thoughts of wanting to be normal again plagued my mind for the first few years, until one time I thought to myself “how did it feel”. I had realized that this “normal” sensation/perception I was wanting to have back, had become so unfamiliar that I genuinely forgot how it felt. It's been so long that as ridiculous as it may sound I contemplate whether or not this is something I,ve had my entire life, like did ever experience a normal existence? The obvious answer to that question is a yes of course, because I would have had to have had a “normal” existence to acknowledge what I experience now as abnormal. But goes to show how severe my detachment has gotten to the point where I begin to question such things in the first place. Although this disorder may not be as disruptive to daily life such as schizophrenia,bi polar disorder and depression, it is certainly something that will have an impact on daily life to an extent. I have had many great moments in my life since my first episode, but precious moments of happiness,love,intimacy get spoiled because of my ability to not fully be in the moment. Although this “feeling” is mostly static throughout the day in moments of high emotions, whether it be joy,anxiety and any other emotion that is heightened for a moment, I will enter a even deeper state of dissociation where i'm practically watching a scene of my life play out in front me, with front row seats. Present moments instantly become memories, at times it would feel like that moment didn't even happen. It's like I'm no longer the main character in my own story. I've never been suicidal but thoughts like what purpose is their to life became occasional. Even with all of that being said late 2020/early 2021 came a pivotal part in my life, due to extreme isolation because of covid I had a lot of time to think and began to become frustrated with not only my disorder but my life as a whole. “There has to be more to life than this,right?” was in repeat in my head, frustration grew so much to the point I decided that something had to change. Obsession with wanting to improve,progress and have purpose fueled me to start pursuing new avenues. In this time I would go from 249 lbs to 193 lbs, started prioritizing the way I looked, started to break certain comforts and began taking risks. But the most important part was my change of mindset, I started to believe that “no one is coming to save you”, so if things want to start changing for the better it all started with me and I solely was responsible for how my life will turn out. I stopped worrying about things out of my control, took accountability for things I was doing wrong, and most importantly stopped blaming others or making excuses for why I wasn't content with my life. For the remainder of highschool that was in person learning, I made big strides socially and mentally. I made new connections, competed in sports, attended social events and many other things that gave me a reason to look forward to the next day. As mentioned before even though a lot of these great experiences were unfortunately tainted or were not experienced to fullest it was nonetheless still fulfilling to an extent. Although dissociation has been a detriment to everyday life, it taught me that sometimes individuals can get too caught up in wanting to feel as happy as they can (drinking,partying,smoking) and not establishing goals to chase after. Striving to achieve fulfillment is something I've taken from my experience from the last few years. Im now 20 years old, who has been recently hired as a first time emt, who plans to transition into the fire department. I never post on forums, but thought I would this time as way to vent, but to also maybe bring relief to those who are may be experiencing dissociation for the first time who may feel lost, scared of what's going on with them, being misunderstood about their symptoms and just need someone to relate to. I also hope to help those who have had this for awhile and can maybe take away from what I said so far. My final thoughts are that if you are going through this right now, as much of a detriment it can be, don't let this be the reason for your life to not progress. As stuck as you may feel, that doesn't mean your life has to get stuck as well. I know that being out of touch with your emotions/body can make it difficult to want to pursue things since the good emotions associated with them aren't primary drivers for us any more. But you have to move forward regardless. Accept this disorder, don't try to act like it's not there, it will only make it worse, the sooner you accept it, the easier it is to live with. The way I look at things is for however long this “thing” ends up being with me. I won't let it be the reason why my goals,aspirations, and dreams aren't met. So that if I'm so lucky to wake up from this “dream"", that my life is of such great value that I will cherish it more than most because I would know truly what a beautiful thing and privilege it is to feel alive.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi guys,

I'm just looking for a listening ear and a space to vent I guess. I'm a man in my late 30s. I've always struggled with social anxiety ever since my early teens. I experienced years of bullying at school that really effected my self esteem.

I've definitely pushed through things and with the aid of self help and sheer determination I've managed to pull myself together and lead a normal life. But it wasn't easy.

Occasionally when I'm out and about I'm acutely aware of certain groups of people and their reactions to me. I've had people laughing at me, and overall making me feel inferior. Some people make it so obvious and don't try to hide it, particularly younger adults.

Today I was out walking with a friend of mine and we passed a young couple. I didn't recognise either of them. Just as we passed them I overheard the male say whisper ""that's....."" followed by laughter. I tried not to let this get the better of me and continued walking. But in the end I looked around and saw the guy laughing back at me.

I know some people might say, stop being paranoid he could have been laughing at anything and you can't read his mind. But it doesn't take away the fact that I feel personally attacked after this incident. This inconsiderate moron ruined what was otherwise a lovely day for me.

How do I cope with such situations? They seem to follow me everywhere and I'm just fed up of it.

I'm a tall thin guy, I've often been mocked for my appearance despite the fact that I've been told I'm handsome by some. I work with the public so perhaps this guy has seen me around before. I really don't know what his problem with me was. ",Social anxiety,1742074701.0,1jc5vir
MentalHealthSupport,"I've gone through depression, multiple times, since I was 10yo. I remember the feeling when I was at my lowest, the despair, the sadness, the darkness, the void. Luckily for me, I had OCD (still do) and a giant fear of dying. Which helped staying in the world of the living to be honest. Also years of therapy and medication. 
Now, I feel... good. Have been for a couple of years.  It's weird to say it because I remember I honestly never thought it possible. But it did get better. 
Now my brother is going through depression (has been for 2+ years) and the irony is that I have no fucking clue what to do. It really scares me. He's young (21), lives alone, doesn't really know what do to with his life, doesn't really go to school anymore, doesn't talk about his life or what he's going through, says he's not happy and never has been.
I'm scared for him and I'm also angry because I'm scared. Angry because he doesn't reply to any messages or reply weeks after, he ghosts everyone, he says he'll see a doctor but then he doesn't, he says he doesn't want help, doesn't want to go to therapy. I don't want to push him and I try to stay chill and supportive, but I also really want to drive to his apartment and shake the heck out of him.

I'm both depressed and extremely angry about this, even though most people dropped out for legit reasons but a few others were flakes who I think could have communicated better with me. I'm not actually angry at anyone in particular as nobody owes me their time but I am absolutely fed up to absolute death of not feeling like a priority in anyone's life. I attended multiple friend's 30ths recently where dozens of people showed up for a big dance hall party and I have to deal with basically nobody in my life celebrating me? I've brought this feeling up on Reddit before and some replies amounted to 'why are you as a grown man upset nobody came to your birthday? What are you, a child?' which doesn't help this feeling and frankly is a c**ty thing to say.

It's on me to improve this for myself, as I am admittedly absolutely terrible at making meaningful connections with people out of fear and growing up with worthless role models.

I will no doubt get loads of messages and questions asking how it went and I don't know how to react honestly without looking like a bitter asshole or a giant loser.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello there!
Just in case, English isn't my native language, so sorry for any mistakes.
Let me start my story right from the beginning.

Last year, I (now 16F) started talking to a guy — let's call him Mark (now 15M). He was a friend of my friend Joseph and also my classmate.
I never thought I would talk to him, and I definitely never expected to fall in love with him.

You know, he was really nice to me. He flirted with me, told me how beautiful I was, and etc. (I'll decorate the story with emojis to show the timeline)

🌇
In April last year, he confessed that he liked me. I was shocked and happy, but he didn’t want a relationship — you know, just a school fling. After that, he started asking for inappropriate things (iykyk), stopped giving me compliments, and even started saying that I was actually ""mid."" So yeah...

In May, Mark started chatting more with his cousin. I didn’t really mind that, but I didn’t like hearing how amazing his cousin was all the time.

🌅
In the summer, we started arguing a lot. I began insulting him, but he still tried his best to save our friendship. Later, I asked him for a break, and a week after that, I apologized — but he ignored me. That continued until August.

Also, I talked with Joseph about Mark, and Joseph insulted him — calling him fat and other things. Around that time, I also started seeing mirror numbers (11:11; 12:12; 00:00, etc.).

Later, I found out from my friend that Mark had changed schools.

🍁
In the fall, I started talking more with another friend of his, Andrew. I noticed two things 
1. Mark still responded to Andrew
2. His sister, Mimi, who stayed in my school. Honestly, I felt like I was the problem. 

A few days later, Mark blocked me.

In October (or something like that), I asked his friend to talk to him about me, and I only heard bad things. Mark didn’t need me at all — he didn’t even need his old friends. All he cared about was his cousin.

I forgot about him until January. Somehow, I managed to fall out of love with him.

☃️
In January, I started seeing his face in crowds, hearing his name, and dreaming about him — and it’s still happening.

I thought for a long time about whether I should write to him or not. Eventually, I did — but he ignored me. The next day, I tried again, and this time, he replied. We started talking again, but he was as cold as Siberia in winter.

I stopped communicating with Joseph. When I mentioned Joseph to Mark, he said he didn’t care about that, and he will continue to chat with him. I wanted to talk to Mark about everything that happened — to clear things up and start from scratch — but he said he didn’t want that.

In the summer, Mark didn’t want to be friends with Joseph, but now they’re chatting again. Honestly, I feel like the guy I knew was kidnapped and replaced by someone else.

Last week, I asked Mark to play something on his guitar (he recently started learning), and he just said, ""Go fuck yourself already."" After that, I stopped messaging him.

Now Mark is moving closer to my school soon, and Joseph lives nearby as well. Joseph has a bad habit of not being able to keep his mouth shut, so yeah... I’m really worried about that.

I talked to my aunt about all of this, and she said I should just get over it — that those ""relationships"" weren’t healthy. My mom, on the other hand, said that if I like him, I should talk to him.

Also, when I hear his name from his friends, I get triggered — my hands start shaking, and everything starts to be noisy

MentalHealthSupport,"Managing anxiety effectively involves adopting strategies that help control stress and reduce anxiety levels. Here are some proven methods:

1. Practice Focused Breathing
Breathing exercises are a powerful anxiety attack treatment. Try these techniques:

- Box Breathing: Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, and hold again for 4. Repeat several times.

- 4-4-4 Breathing: Inhale for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts, and repeat for 5 minutes.
These methods help lower stress and anxiety by calming the nervous system.

2. Engage in Physical Activity

She was a narcissist (the 'woe is me' kind) and a textbook manipulator. She would often mentally, verbally and emotionally abuse me.

It also didn't help that her daughter, a narcissist as well, and constantly bullied me and my older cousin who also lived there would SA me.

Thankfully, I moved to the US in November to live with my mother, brother, sister in law and nephew. I like it here a lot more, my parents and brother are very sweet and supportive. It's a more peaceful environment than what l'm used to back in Jamaica.
So far l've been adjusting to life in the US pretty well and it's been especially easy with my mom and brother.

It was with me, in my old house in Jamaica and my younger cousin, who is about 9, also lived there.

Many other of my cousins who also lived with my aunt would also say she was a horrible person but she had brainwashed that side of the family so much that if you speak out you'll be ignored or berated.

I'm also scared that he won't be able tell that they're abusing him. It was especially hard for me to expect because everyone treated my aunt and her daughter like a delicate flower that needed protection instead of the evil woman she is.

MentalHealthSupport,I suffer from CPTSD and I have really bad depression I’ve been battling this for years I’m just looking to get good support and just want to recover from all that I’ve been through I believe there is a hope ,Hello,1741999852.0,1jbj8k7
MentalHealthSupport,"Hey so this is all going to seem really fucking weird. Before you ask I have contacted my therapist and I'm talking to her next week but from the half session we had earlier this week where I tried to talk to her about it she could pick out a few I guess obvious parts but a lot of it she sort of dismissed because it sounds crazy and incomprehensible which is honestly fair. I don't think I'd understand this either if I wasn't experiencing it. 

Additional notes this is a cleared out old throwaway, because I don't really want this on my main for reasons that might make sense when I explain all this weirdness. Also I have EUPD autism, ADHD and Ptsd diagnosed with a history of anxiety and depression as well as buliema and a history of psychosis though it tends to come in short bursts of like a few hours. I am.medicated with anti depressants, mood stablisers and anti anxietymeds as well as ritalin. If anyone has experienced anything like this with a similar history I'd love to know so I feel a little less crazy. Also this is going to be long. There's a lot of context to make there even a chance of this making sense. 

So when I was a kid I was a super devout chirstian. Jesus camp type stuff. My mom said she had visions from God. And relevant to this I used to compulsively pray. In like an OCD way, which was one of the things my therapist was able to note from this mess.  But the thing was that everything I prayed for always ended up happening. 

When I was about 13 my mom died, she was a pretty huge piece of shit and my life is objectively better without her. The grieving process was rough as it is for everyone but at the same time there was a part of me that was glad. 

After she died I became a completely different person, lost my faith and became basically the stereotypical reddit atheist. I still am, at least I think I am. I always just chalked the change up to the fact that everyone changes at that age and I went through a pretty heavy tramatic event so it makes sense. Now I'm not so sure. 

I was brought up by my dad and he is great, he's wonderful, but he is super bad with emotions and very much repressed them and encouraged that with me a lot too. 

Fast forward to about 2 years ago. I'm in a stable loving relationship with another woman (which will be relevant) she's amazing and starts getting me to open up and acknowledge my emotions way more. But she has some of her own issues with severe mental illness and has an episode of psychosis that was pretty rough on me.

 Afterwards I start getting these episodes, my doctors have kinda just shrugged and called them psudeoseziures. Basically whenever I get stress or overwhelmed or scared, my body completely shuts down. I collapse, I can't move anything but a few limbs, sometimes body parts spasm on their own sometimes I even stop breathing but i always start again once I start actually suffocating. It's the sort of thing that's teriffying the first few times but when you've been dealing with it for years it's just a major annoyance. Sometimes after I start being unable to speak other than repeating other words people say for a while. Or I just get exhausted and need a nap. 

Fast forward again to about 3 months ago. My girlfriend and I are staying at my dad's for the holidays and when we're there we often sleep in separate rooms for snoring reasons. I'm in bed winding down and I have a seizure. It's not really a big deal, but I start kind of looking inside myself a bit. Like almost in a dreamscape sense? It's hard to describe. And I start to notice this like terrifed child version of myself that's begging to be acknowledged. 

I kinda let it out and let it take over a bit to try and communicate? I guess. Anyway, at this point I have no control over my body at all but I'm still conscious enough to know what's happening just not able to control it. The child version Is struggling to control my body and wanders out to go see my girlfriend who I can tell it really likes. It goes and climbs in next to her and she starts talking to me half asleep and it doesn't know how to talk back so it just stares at her smiling.

It lays down into the bed and she starts spooning me the way she always does. But whatever version of me that's taken over doesn't like being constricted. It says no quietly but my gf half asleep doesn't hear. And panicked, it bites her hard. Way too hard. Not enough to draw blood or bruise but still. My girlfriend rightfully freaks out and whatever that version of me was panics at making her upset and retreats enough to give me control again. 

I explain what happened to my girlfriend, she's is rightfully really weirded out and pretty scared but so am I. She also is very aware personally of severe mental health stuff not making you act like yourself so she is probably more understanding than most people would be. 

We're kinda grappling with what the fuck to do when that version just kinda, merges with the normal me me. And I start to realise it's my emotions. So deeply weird, hate that that happened, but whatever it was it's somehow resolved itself and afterwards I feel better? Not cured or anything but more stable, more in touch with my emotions which is something my GF has wanted from me for ages. 

So cut to a few days ago. It's the week of the 10 year anniversary of my mom's death and my dad is in a really rough way. We're across the country and my and my dads cat who we got right after my mom died is really sick.  He's been slowing down for about a year and now he's not eating and barely moving from the bed and my dad is certain he's gonna die. He doesn't want to take him to the vet because he doesn't want him to stress out in his final days. I'm debating going home but he tells me not to because he doesn't want to stress the cat out. 

I'm completely inconsolable, and I start talking to my girlfriend about positive memories of my mom for the first time ever. She's always said talking to my dad and me about her is like 2 completely different people. He is mourning a dead wife he has basically only good memories of and I well, don't really ever think about the good because it's so out weighed by the bad. 

The next morning, that same weird brain thing happens expect this time it's with like the teenage version of me that I stopped being when she died. It doesn't fully take over but it very very present and sometimes over powering me. I explain it to my girlfriend and she says well keep an eye on it. 

During that day I start compulsively praying again constantly,  like I'll leave the room mid conversation because I'm certain I need to pray. Then I start losing it because I'm dating a woman who I love so much but I'm certain it's a sin and I'm going to be punished for it. I start noticing that my luck has been really really bad ever since I stopped praying, everything just always seems to go wrong, it's been a decade since I've not had to deal with some kind of insanely stressful crisis. 

I have a break down crying to my girlfriend that I don't know if I can be with her, we manage to consol it, I start kinda slowly making myself listen to baby's first queer stuff, Chappel roan transcends whatever the fuck this is apparently.  

It's now undercontrol enough that I think I'm not going to end my relationship on a whim but I'm still praying all the time and the weird fucking thing is it's working? It's not working for big stuff but I prayed for my girlfriend medical stuff to be fine and it was but weirdest of all, I prayed for my cat to live, and the next day he's suddenly miraculously recovered? He's healthier than he has been in years, more active, eating all the time, back to his old self. So I just don't really know what the fuck is going on?

I've looked into DID but I don't have the amnesia symptom which is pretty core to that condition. I'm just really confused and any help at all or similar resources or even some way I can try and explain this to my therapist would be really really appreciated.

MentalHealthSupport,"This is my first time posting on reddit so I'm not sure what to do or where to go, but I'm really seeking some advice or reassurance about my brother (15) and how to exist with him in (and currently out of) my life.

I am 20F and the big sister of three boys, one of which has had severe psychosis, schizophrenia & OCD since he was really young. He has spent the past couple months in a psych ward and then in a partial hospitalization program, but he just left two days ago for a months-long residential program in a different state about 6 hours away. My whole family is heartbroken at him being so far away for so long (doctors are saying a minimum of 4 months). I haven't stopped crying since he left. I'm struggling with so many conflicting feelings and it's making me so dizzy and emotionally sick.

It feels like I've lost a sibling, like I'm mourning somebody that hasn't died. My family can't get through one conversation without breaking down at the reminder of his absence. And I am so incredibly depressed, but also, like... a secret part of me is relieved to have him away for a while, which is in turn making me feel like the worst sister in the world. I am so guilty. Already, despite the sadness in my house, the lack of stress and conflict is apparent and SO relieving. Am I a horrible person for feeling sort of partly maybe glad he's where he is right now? I miss him dearly and I'm distraught along with the rest of my family, but I'm also finally taking some deep breaths in a way I haven't been able to in years.

On the other hand, guilt comes from my sadness too. In my head I'm like - how dare I cry and feel so much pity for myself when my brother is far away, lonely, wishing he were home, and struggling so deeply? I have no right to be upset because he is obviously doing far worse. At least I get to be in my own bed. I don't know, I'm just so confused and heartbroken and quietly grateful and I'm losing my mind. Every emotion I have feels wrong and cruel. I can't seem to find peace.

MentalHealthSupport,"I am 18YO, in college.

I am diagnosed with depression, so thats probably all this is, but for some reason I cannot stop lying. Especially to the people I love. I guess it seems easier than risking their judgement. I know they love me and would be here for me and deep down i know they wouldn’t judge. But for some reason it just seems so hard. 

Mostly its just telling people im fine, lying about going to class. Or saying my grades are better than they are. Still lying though.

I also just cant sleep, like not because i cant but because I dont want to. Even before I could talk my parents say I didnt want to sleep. And now its worse, i stay up all night, then end up crashing at like 8:00AM and sleeping through classes. 

I am also completely unmotivated to do anything. I am on anti depressants and so I have moments, sometimes days. Where I actually do things. But most of the time I am unable to get myself to do things I know I need to do. Easy shit, like studying or homework. But especially going to class. I make excuses like “i can do all the stuff from home” and then I dont study or do homework and when the time comes around I chat GPT stuff, and then I end up skipping tests or finding ways to cheat.

Most of my issues are a lack of motivation and the a lack of discipline. Like How do people get themselves to do things they don’t want to? I just cant do it.

The answer to my questions is just therapy right? But I cant get myself to do it.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi all!

In general, I'm a very down to earth and easy going person. In a professional setting, I have no issues with receiving feedback or criticism. However, I've come to realize that I feel very hurt when my husband criticizes what I did in the household, or doesn't mention something I did. We have a pretty even division of house tasks, both have full time jobs, that's not the issue at all. It's very specific. I clean the kitchen, he comes home, and doesn't mention it. And I feel rejected. Or, I've done all sorts of household tasks, but he doesn't compliment me about it (and is annoyed that I didn't do a specific thing, or that I didn't do it his way). It's not like he's always negative, I do this back to him as well, but I've noticed I get really, really emotional and 'reptile brain' about it.

  
Growing up, my mom was always super stressed and angry about anything that I didn't do a 100% her way. Looking back, I think she had autistic tendencies. She was very, very specific about how certain things had to be put away, cleaned, etc. She would get very upset and angry if it didn't go her way. It drove me crazy and I always tried to please her, to avoid fights and a bad mood in the home. One day, I vividly remember wanting to surprise her with a lunch. I was at an age where I didn't really know where to find plates, put things on the table, etc, so I was sure she would be positively surprised. However, I somehow spilled juice and didn't know how to clean it up, so I put a cloth over it and thought she wouldn't mind. But when she came home, she got really upset about the spilled juice and (in my memory) never said anything about the effort I put in. This might sound silly and a small thing, but I've recently realized this was a 'core memory' that hurts me until this day, and that it's probably also related to how I now handle 'criticism' or 'lack of compliments' from my husband.  
  
I'm 35 years old. Just to clarify: my husband isn't negative all the time. He can be, but it's mostly how I perceive this. We have good conversations about this and he tries to be understanding. I'm just curious if there's a specific term for what I'm experiencing. Is this fawning/people pleasing or something else? It's also specifically about hoping to get compliments for what I did, and being VERY (like ridiculously) disappointed when he doesn't see it or mention it. It's really frustrating and I feel super silly about it. I'd love to read up about it and figure out a way to improve my feelings about these things. It's not worth the energy!

Battling demons hidden from sight.
They whispered in shadows, clawed at my mind,
And now I believe they’ve only grown inside.

A family once close, now turned away,
Accusing me of lies they chose to say.
The one I loved, my own flesh and blood,
Told me I was wrong, left me misunderstood.

My mother’s mind shattered, a storm on display,
Her bipolar rage swept my world away.
In her madness, I questioned my own,
Wondering if I, too, was broken and alone.

Betrayed me with lies, shattered all plans.
Accused of something I never did,
Their words left scars I can’t rid.

Each love I’ve known has shaped my despair,
They promised forever, but none could care.
I gave all of me, but they broke me apart,
And now I’m afraid to open my heart.

I fear the silence, the loneliness deep,
But in the quiet, I’ve learned to weep.
No one beside me, no hand to hold,
Just me and the void, where I’m left in the cold.

MentalHealthSupport,"Please ignore errors in my writing, English is not my first language.

I'm a college student, at a critical juncture of my life, having to prepare and sit for exams for my higher studies. In the meantime, things in my family aren't going very well. My parents have been feuding for the past 3 months for mistakes my father had made. It hurts seeing my mother in so much pain, while I can't do anything about it. (Mind you the kind of society I live in, divorce is seen as a bad thing, and my mother is gonna suffer more afterwards if she goes that way). I'm doing everything I can to support her, knowing it's all in vain. We've always been struggling financially ever since I was born, but at least there was some peace. There was love between us. Not anymore. My house hasn't felt like home in months.

I have a lovely girlfriend. I've been dating her for about a year now, she has brought me nothing but calm, peace, and joy. I had a really toxic and manipulative Ex before her, and I had never known love could feel like this. We're both the same age, both in the same situation, giving exams, as we both have the same goal. She suffers from chronic anxiety. We've given 2 exams and the 3rd one coming later this month, and she hasn't really done well in the first two. And that's expected, given none of us prepared for that much. I did decent, I had a thorough understanding of the subjects, but so did she. Here comes the sad part. She gets so harsh with herself, constantly calling herself names, like dumb, stupid, worthless and what not. When in reality a lot of the mistakes she had made were evidently from performance anxiety, not being confident enough to even attempt questions. She has been giving mock exams for the 3rd one coming this month, really studying for it too, but she is getting more and more demoralised from the mock results, to the point I had to tell her to stop doing them. Recently it has gone so much worse, as she tells me she's gonna end her life after this exam goes south too. She says she is tired of living like a failure, like a burden to her parents who have high expectations from her. In reality, she's the kind of person every parent would want as their daughter. She's the kindest soul on the planet. I told her that I am gonna text her mother about it, but she has blocked my number from her's. Education and these exams are really important in our country too.

I've tried everything. I've told her life doesn't stop at an exam going wrong, it's never worth it, but I also understand and can see the kind of pain she's in. She's suffering so much and I can't do anything about it. She's working really hard, she always does, but something messes with the exams right at the moment, which I suspect is the anxiety. She says she sometimes goes blank when seeing questions, and she really really works too hard. Which makes the pain even worse for her. I've tried everything, told her everything she might need to hear. She already seems to have made her decision.

I myself have dealt with exam failure and suicidal tendencies in the past, though I'm doing better now. But I too, often feel like it'd be really great if something happens and I go down peacefully. Like in my sleep or something. I will not do anything to myself as I don't want to put that burden on the people around me. But sometimes I feel like it'd be a lot easier if it all stopped. I'm sleeping for the most of my day, staying awake feels like dragging myself across a desert. I'm exhausted.

I really want to help her but I don't know how. I wish I could turn back time and fix whatever the fuck is wrong with my family but I can't do that. I am stuck. I am doing fine by myself. Everything would be fine if I knew how to help my girl. I am doing my best for my mother. It's easier cuz I live with my parents. Not easier with my girlfriend, cuz we haven't been dating for long and I'm not introduced to her parents yet. Both of our mothers know about our relationship and that's it. I wish I could just go inside her head and kill all the self hatred she holds towards her. It's killing her. And seeing her in such pain is killing me too.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello, I’m not usually one to post but I need to get this off my chest somehow...

It’s been really hard, I can’t tell anyone irl so why not the internet?

Recently, ever since exams have started, I’ve been looking at myself so lowly. I feel so stupid and like I’m brainless or something. My self esteem has been so low to the point where I don’t see myself as a valuable person anymore or even AS a person at all, I feel like I shouldn’t have been birthed at all and that I’m just a burden to everyone I love and trust and that I shouldn’t have existed. I have a long history with self- harm, I’m disappointed with myself because I recently relapsed. No one knows I did because if I told anyone, I’m 100% sure they’d yell at me instead of listening to what my thoughts have been..

Ive been isolating myself from my friends and even from my family- I feel like I don’t deserve them, like It’s better if I wasn’t here to be such a burden to them. All my friends are smart, pretty, witty, funny, talented, and popular.. I love them so much but they have other friends who are as smart as them, as pretty as them, as popular as them, as talented as them.. I’m just me, a brainless person who’s mediocre compared to them, a person only there to make them laugh and to entertain them because that’s the only thing I’m good at. We’re usually a group of four but I feel like recently they’ve been replacing me…(maybe I’m overthinking it actually lol) I doubt that I’m any use for them at this point. My family, they could have more opportunities if I weren’t here to drag them down, if I wasn’t so mentally ill and utterly stupid, they’d have someone to be proud of. It’s come to the point where I don’t think I’m worth anything anymore… Intrusive thoughts of running away, cutting everyone off, and “selling my body because my body’s the only thing that has worth” or simply just ending my life have been plaguing me and driving me insane. I really don’t know what to do anymore.

Thank you for reading this stupid vent, I hope I don’t sound like some emo brat who wants attention…lol. Also sorry for any punctuation mistakes… English isn’t my first language, sorry in advance.

MentalHealthSupport,"This is gonna feel like it is just a procrastination issue. **But I feel that there is something deeply wrong with my mind.**

I always fail to meet most goals that I set, no matter how simple. I make elaborate plans to improve **but always end up sabotaging myself**. I have ambitions and long term goals but my actions are the exact opposite. 

One example: I had an end term exam where I was sure to fail if I did not study. I told myself that I will finish studying 3 days before.( actually very ez). That became 1 day. Then the very morning. Even in the morning I did not study properly (wasted time on reddit.) **Then I gave up. I FAILED.** The same has happened so many times, you would not believe it. 

FYI: My mode of procrastination is mindless internet surfing. I don't do it on my smartphone (everything blocked). I do it on my laptop instead. No matter what I try, I cannot live without mindless scrolling. I want it to feel normal.  Also, I have a p\*rn addiction which I can't quit no matter what.

MentalHealthSupport,"Not sure if this is the right place, but I just wanted to hear about other people opinion and experiences. 

I (30F) have been diagnosed with deep depression (drug-resistant) for years now. Have tried a couple different antidepressants with little to no improvement. Currently I only take vyvanse as it is the only thing which makes me a functioning human being, and rivotril when needed.

A quick overview of my mental health (without vyvanse) would be that Im mostly always depressed/very low energy, with eventual changes where I get more ""awaken"", motivated, have ideas, do things, so and so. I would not describe this as ""mania"" because my energy level is still so low compared with a normal person, but I feel better during in these phases, as I am desperate to have energy and do things. But they are also short lived and very sparse.  I may also have autism, but I haven't seek a diagnostic. 

My doctor recently prescribed me mood stabilizers, starting today. It seems that there are evidences that it can be helpful for my type of depression, but I am concerned it will ""flatten"" my higher-energy peaks and make me stay in the middle of the way between barely function and functional depressed person. 

What I hope is that it will help me feel more like when I am in the good phases.

Maybe this is just overthinking because its what I do. And when this happens I like to read about other peoples experiences, so it would be nice if anyone else with a similar place could tell me a little about their experience.

MentalHealthSupport,"Trigger warnings: self harm/addiction 


I (25F) have struggled with mental health issues from the age of 10, grew up in a household with a BPD/traumatized mother that relied on me a lot for emotional support but also could never provide me support. When my mental health took a real nose dive during college I started smoking mj and drinking to cope. I got into a relationship with someone with narcissistic traits and was on and off in that relationship, it caused me a lot of pain and trauma. He was abusive in all ways. I was isolating myself and SH. After college I lived at home for a year which was kind of a nightmare. Then I moved to another state for a job and still struggled to manage there, I was well liked and did good work but was lonely and still abusing mj and alcohol. I ended up developing an addiction to shoplifting and eventually got caught and had to go to court. 

Luckily this was my first ever brush with the law and got the lightest sentence. Flash forward a year and I got a dream job at a residential psychiatric facility for teens struggling with BPD. I felt this was a great fit because I have experience with mental health struggles and DBT which is the type of therapy they do at the facility. For some reason the background check did not catch my shoplifting charge the first time around so I was fine but 6 months into my job I get a call from HR telling me I can’t come into work. I end up having to submit all this information about the charge, court documents, two letters of recommendation attesting that this won’t interfere with my work with minors, and a personal statement. The bureaucratic nature of this has left me unable to go to work for about 3 months. I am still awaiting their descison on whether or not I can return and pass the background check. The state board cannot give me any type of timeline. At first I started smoking every day and then realized I needed to stop. I started going to marijuana anonymous meetings, was regularly taking my antidepressants, exercising every day, meditating, journaling, reading, doing hobbies. I have 32 days of sobriety from weed under my belt. I have a somewhat new boyfriend that has been incredibly supportive throughout this I am so grateful. Despite these healthy changes I got drunk a couple of times and felt horrible about it and the last time led to a self harm relapse. My boyfriend came over to support me and I felt awful. Ever since I stopped smoking my ptsd symptoms due to my childhood and past DV/SA have been coming back. I feel like I’m too “messed up” for my job or to become a therapist or that I’m only doing it because it’s what I was basically trained to do from an early age in my family. I know it isn’t so black and white and my experiences make me good at what I do but this is easily the most stressful time of my life and I’m struggling to find self love. If anyone can offer words of support I’d appreciate that a lot.

MentalHealthSupport,"There's a sort of ""stage"" of clynical depression where the affected person engages in reality denial, or can't seem to make sense of even obvious solutions, in a way that feeds or enables the depression.

An example is a patient has intensive surgery that has them glued to a hospital bed for months. During physical therapy they're improving their mobility, as indicated by a progressive increase in laps around the hospital, but the patient chocks it up to the hospital doing renovation work that shortens the hallways.

Every direction feels like a dead end that only serves to continue for the sake of it. Like going on only serves to feed the thing killing the host. I know on paper there is a way out of this, just not for me. There's a sense of having fallen too far that makes every effort seem insulting or futile.

The thing I feel shame for is that I knew this was a dangerous place to get to for a long time. I told myself it would never happen to me. Between 2 years of not drinking, my grandfather coming down with dementia, an urgent move, evenrs in my country, and a constant influx of relatives that rips open some deep wounds, a once defiant insistence on continuing has halted into this whimpering urge to curl up and be left alone.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi! I’m a 16 year old guy living with my parents and my older sister. (20f)
ever since I was a kid there have been constant issues, my sister failed various classes and made up extravagant lies to others to garner attention. There was no childhood trauma for her, she was raised and loved by both of my parents even after my birth. She was given every resource needed to succeed and accommodate her no matter what new diagnosis or medication she had. 
When I was 7 she sexually assaulted me with the full intent to do so. That left me extremely scarred and immediately caused me to fear her which lead to resentment. My parents raised me in a very similar manner to my sister and many disorder’s I’ve been diagnosed with are merely hereditary or caused from the damage my sister has caused. My parents did everything from testing to therapy to medical treatments and medication, but they will not put her in a ward or home. She is willingly unhygienic and lazy, she has destroyed the upstairs in which she lives by her bodily fluids. I haven’t been up there in some times due to how awful the smell is but it’s a mix of anything you could probably get out of your body. She will destroy things and blow money for no reason and acts purely on impulse. She has little to no teeth as she ripped them out starting around my age. She gained fifty pounds within the past year due to her no longer having a job she quit and doing nothing with her life. She sleeps with a countless amount of men and does this all out of her own free will. She is a toddler in a sense, if she doesn’t get her way she will scream and cry and throw a literal tantrum in the sense that a young child would. She’ll be petty and mock and make fun of others as an elementary bully does. Some days she will act completely innocent, like she’s never done a thing wrong in her life and she’s completely helpless. Other days she’s extremely “ghetto” in a sense, acting like she’s someone in the streets of a run down town and talking back with slurs and words she can’t even say. She’s run away various times, and now that she’s an adult my parents can’t do anything about it. Almost every test has been positive but I’ve always been so certain none of them are correct. Medication won’t work and she merely lies in therapy the entire time, my parents have given up years ago after she made it very clear she won’t put in any effort to better her life despite having the resources and support to do so.

This has lead to my own troubles of emotional regulation to where I take matters into my own hands and resort to violence to defend myself of her, and I’ve grown to become a short tempered person who has urges to physically put people in their place. I cannot handle certain sounds as they bring me back to certain times where something horrible went wrong, and I’ll end up a mess on the floor. I hate going home, knowing she’ll be there.

I genuinely cannot live like this anymore, it’s been 16 years of torture and college seems like the only way out for me but I don’t want my parents to suffer. Please, if there’s any suspicion or hint on what’s wrong with her or what can be done please tell me. She cannot be treated lightly as you will be manipulated and harmed further.

i can’t even bare to look at myself in the mirror without seeing so much disgust, it doesn’t help that my family has started commenting on my weight EVERYTIME they see me, deadass why did my moms bf stop me in the middle of getting ready and tell me i’m getting “ ridiculously big” and im not going to get it off no time soon?? and my mom is sitting there looking fucking stupid giggling??? it doesn’t help that i’ve been struggling with an ed

i’m home for spring break now and it’s like everything has gotten worse. i have a bf and i love him so much and we’ve been together for a year now and he’s so patient with me, but my mood is so out of whack that i can snap in second. like we would be all happy and then out of nowhere i start breaking down sobbing, or just snap at him for the tiniest things ever, and he’s been there for me through it all but he doesn’t deserve this at all. he’s the sweetest person ever and i hate when i all of a sudden snap at him and i always apologize when i realized what ive done and then i start sobbing uncontrollably because i feel bad and get scared that he doesn’t love me anymore.

i swear im trying to get better but it’s so hard to get help. especially since ive been seeing things recently. like i’ve almost crashed 3 times this week because i would be driving and then i see something in the middle of the road and swerve off the road and it’s happening even more now. or i would be chilling and then i feel things crawling on me but nothing is there at all. and it’s fucking terrifying, and it doesn’t help that i keep hearing things.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi, all. I'm a 33 year old woman. Up until a year or two ago, I really didn't have any interests outside of reading, playing video games, and watching TV. I work, but never really gave it my all. Basically if it wasn't super interesting, I couldn't care less. Mingle in with this that the things I was SUPPOSED to do, I'd always do them half-way if I did them at all. A little over a year ago though, I went to a regular medical doctor and made a joke about never remembering anything because I HAVE to make a reminder on my phone for anything or it didn't happen, and she asked me a number of questions. At that point, she diagnosed me with ADHD and a binge eating disorder (which is definitely true) and prescribed me Vyvanse. My significant other thinks I should see a psychiatrist to prove I actually have ADHD, but honestly that's not the main problem. For the past year or two, it's like I pick something and I want to do it CONSTANTLY. Then, I basically shut down every other aspect of my life, focus completely on that one thing, get tired of it, set it aside, and two weeks later it's something else. Before it was crocheting, then it was diamond painting, and right now, it's making customizable trading cards and bookmarks and such (again reading is the one hobby I've never put down, basically since I learned how to read I've been reading). My boyfriend owns a business and I work there. He's been coming into work in the morning and seeing little scraps of paper all over the place from where I'm trying to learn how to make everything properly sized and such, and then scrap paper that I printed and messed up that I'm just using as an in-between layer now to add thickness to cards/not totally waste all of the paper. He's at his wits end. He thinks I'm either depressed or just generally unhappy with my life and that's why I'm like this, but for the most part I feel fairly happy. I have always kind of been the type of person that felt like I wasn't much of anything but wanted to be, if that makes sense, but haven't actually put the effort into being those things. Idk what's wrong with me. My boyfriend has put up with my shortcomings for sixteen years, and of course I don't want to lose him, and I don't want to upset him either, as he has his own health issues that really require him to stay calm as much as he can.

MentalHealthSupport,"Long story short, I'm in my late twenties and finally found steady work to gain my grounding in life after too many years spent in college. Yet, plenty of small yet irking events have been adding up in my life to the point where it feels stressful to even go back home after a day at work. I sometimes even find myself looking for an excuse or another task to pick up at work just so that I wouldn't have to go home and deal with anything that is not related to my job.

Worse enough, these are entirely minuscule annoyances that shouldn't even be a bother. Things such as:

* Not upgrading my phone in 8 years. When I finally have bought a more recent model, it has been stuck in transport for several weeks to the point where I am worried that it is lost.
* I wanted to reconnect to people on a social media account that I haven't touched in roughly two years. I finally gained the courage to login only to find that my account has been deleted and my username has been snatched up by a bot.
* My wisdom teeth have been terribly painful and I have to wait another 2 months to be examined by an oral surgeon. 
* The underside of my car of 14 years is now rattling like crazy. I keep going underneath it to work on it (it's rusted to high hell due to the usage of salt on local roads across the entire winter) without any end to the rattling, even after removing the loose heat shields. I'm stuck trying to figure out how to afford a new car while battling with the student loans that I need to pay off.
* I need a decent pillow to sleep on. I've been sleeping on this pulverized thing for over four years at this point. I don't even know where to purchase pillows from.

My motivation is at an all-time low at this point. I try to combat one issue and it leads to the discovery of several others. It's like I'm using my work as an excuse to escape all of my problems. Theoretically, if I could eat, sleep, clean up, and literally exist at my workplace, I likely would just to escape everything else that is gnawing at me in life.","I feel like things are falling apart.

MentalHealthSupport,"(Throwaway account so my friends and family dont find this, not because I don't want them to, i just need an unbiased take from people who dont know me. )


I (21 M) have some mental heath issues, the normal depression, anxiety, a bit of complex ptsd from a not so nice upbringing, maybe a drinking problem. 

Standard stuff. 

Nothing too crazy, perfectly treatable right? 
But the issue is that when I actually try and get help of any kind, like when i go out of my way to to talk to a mental health professional or a doctor I get this mental block thing that stops me saying anything important and then If I try and push past it I feel nauseous?? 

For example I was talking to a trauma councillor over lock down because a social worker referred me to them and every session I tried to bring up important information to them about how I was doing but all that I could actually get out was that I was fine other than I was a bit down and wanted to go out, but I was doing horribly, my mental state was atrocious, my routine was in shambles, i was failing school and I wanted to be dead and they where exactly who i should have told, I was theoretically able to get help but i couldn't.

When I try and focus on specific things that happened it's like it's all out of reach, I get messed up by something someone says or does and burst out crying or shut down but then if someone asks about it I cant seem to even realise what did it or what happened. It's like there's a brick wall between me and how I was feeling five minutes ago and if I try to remember I just feel sick and shaky. Even writing this I can feel my chest tightening and it's the same when I try talking to my friends. I have no idea what is wrong with me and I can't get help because when I try I can't talk about the problem and I look like I'm exaggerating how bad I'm feeling. If anyone has any advice is really appreciate it because I feel like I'm actually going insane.

Tldr: 
When I am in the presence of someone who can help me with my issues I have a mental block that stops me being able to talk to them about my issues and is having a serious impact on my life, does anyone have advice?

They're the type to say as long as you did your best on the test thats good enough. but I don't know why everytime when I try to explain something (they don't understand) to them, tears just started forming. I just feel frustrated that they they don't understand my explanation (maybe because I'm impatient and suck at explaining) I always told myself "" next time, I shouldn't cry becuase I'm just explaining something to them that they don't understand. What is there to cry about?"" I also don't know what's  the reason for my tears but when that next time came, my tears just dropped so much. I feel like whenever I try to explain myself, explain my pov, explaining the reason why I decided to do something I get frustrated that they don't seem to understand me. They're supportive but from my pov, they're not the most empathetic people. I think this mostly happens when I'm with my dad. My dad is someone that does almost everything in our family. Cooking, manage taxes, make sure our prepare lunches for me and my brother, dinner. He helped out a lot around the house. So whenever I try to explain something to him and I cry, I feel really guilty because I feel like he doesn't deserve this treatment (where everytime when I talk to him I feel like crying) I think it's because when he and my mom argues it's really scary to hear his raised voice. But I can't help it i just feel frustrated that he doesn't understand me. That he doesn't understand my situation or try to put himself in my shoes.

As you probably know now I am a very sensitive person. I feel like I cry at every little thing. There are a few times whenever I cry in front of my dad he say to me ""how will you survive in this world if you always cry whenever someone talks to you"" I also question that myself. How can I survive in this world if I am this sensitive. 

What i wish to know are the ways to stop myself from crying when trying to explain or stop myself from crying when someone lectures me, points out my mistakes. I tried to breathing techniques they dont work at all. I tried stepping out of room and calm myself down first but before I can do that tears formed. And even if I calmed myself down when I try again, I just cry again. How will I survive university? How will I survive at jobs?

In conclusion I just have a hard time explaining myself because everytime I do i just cry. I can't even finish my explanation. I think this just happens to me when I face my teachers and my parents.

MentalHealthSupport,"I’m a 22M, in my last year of college. I don’t think I have a single reason to keep living other than “my mom will be sad”. My last relationship was 3 years ago, and I don’t think my friends would care too much if I just disappeared - we’re not that close anyway.

I’m not happy at all. Maybe it’s because I’m job hunting right now (in software industry, so a bit tough right now). I have never enjoyed my major - I got into it for the money, and the money is pretty good to be fair. I’ve felt pretty anxious every time I job searched, but this time is the worst by far. I didn’t get the return offer from an internship I worked my ass off in, and my current internship just had layoffs and a hiring freeze. I’m an anxious person, and I feel like that doubled my anxiety. And my worry is that I would keep feeling like this even after I find a job.

I’ve always had a problem with comparing myself with others. It feels like everyone is ahead of me. I tried so hard, but every night I’m thinking “why is nothing working out for me?”. I see all my friends with great jobs, and everyone on LinkedIn getting positions that I would love to have. I also see a lot of people my age born into retirement money or getting lucky / grinding something for a few years to become rich and retire. I know everyone wants this, but I don’t even want to work, I just want to retire. The thought of working another 40 years for no reason dreads me. I even thought of gambling my savings and just dying if it didn’t work out. I’ve tried so hard, even paid for therapy out of my own pocket to stop myself from comparing myself to others but I can’t seem to get rid of this trait of mine.

But I feel like I should be happy. I have a loving family. I grew up in a decently wealthy family and I have a pretty good amount saved up from my internships, probably top 5% in my age group. There are so many people that have it much worse than me, and I feel like there is no reason for me to feel this sad. But I do.

I’m breaking down several times per day crying. Everytime I see my family I want to cry, and I avoid them everytime I get teary eyed. I don’t want my family to worry because of me. Once my mom told me not to stress too much and that everything will be okay, and I almost broke down crying on the spot. I can’t fall asleep without edibles. I think I had my first anxiety attack today, and I’m losing my ability to focus every day. I’m going to bomb my few interviews that I managed to get at this rate, and I know I’d feel even worse if that happened. I know what I have to do. Just lock in for a few months to grind out for a job, but I just can’t seem to do it.

I know there are issues with my personality. I have trouble making friends anywhere and always feel like an outsider. I think I’m on the autism spectrum, and maybe slightly sociopathic as well. I hate the anxious and depressed trait of mine. I think all this is inherited from my parents - my dad suffers from the same anxiety (i think), and both my parents are slightly sociopathic and always outsiders. I don’t want kids simply because I’m worried my child will have to go through the same life that I am living right now.

Why am I so unhappy? When will I find happiness? Why should I keep living? What is my purpose? I know I’m supposed to be still young, but I feel like I have nothing to live for and nothing to look forward to.","I feel like I should be happy, but I’m not",1741925627.0,1javjj9

I don't try and stick out either, I’m extremely perceptive to social cues, I know what's appropriate and not ect.

I hope you are doing well.

  
So, I just turned 18 last week. I don't know if it's relevant, but yeah. Basically, I am in college right now, and this is my second semester. Last semester, I was an A+ student. I genuinely kept all of my grades above 90 except for two classes (I had 6 classes in general; they were close to 90 but just not in it). However, this semester, I can't do it. Like, I don't feel mentally stimulated enough to study. I don't know how to describe what I am feeling, but I feel like I'm learning nothing. Everything sounds stupid.

I know I'm the problem. I have to push myself harder, but I can't, like I physically can't. I am always tired, and I feel like crap. It's honestly so frustrating that I can't do anything. I feel trapped in this cycle. I can't fail at all. I need to be at the top, not in a superior way, but I just can't bring myself to be second. I need to get these good grades, but I feel like I'm trapped; I can't do it. I joined 3 clubs in the hopes it would motivate me, but it just makes me want to quit even more.

I have two exams tomorrow, and I can't study. I wanna vanish so I don't have to deal with everything. I spent the whole day after classes making up fake scenarios in my head. Literally, guys, you can laugh at me for it; it's fine. But I spent two hours just walking in my room, and I didn't even realize it till my mom called me from downstairs. What the flip, actually, who does this? I feel like I'm losing control of my life right now. I can't hold anything down; I feel stupid and incompetent.

Let me clarify by saying that I’m not sure if this is my mental or physical health.  I don't know what to do anymore. I have been dealing with this problem for maybe 2-3 years now, but it’s consistently getting worse by the day. I've brought it up to multiple different primary care doctors in the past and was always brushed off and given a referral to a psychiatrist. (maybe due to my age, I’m 19, a lot of people think I am overreacting or being a “drama queen.”)

My parents were in a very bad abusive relationship. My father was an alcoholic/addict, very neglectful, and very mentally abusive to us, and physically to my mother. My mom worked nights and slept all day 6-7 days/week. By the time I was 6 or 7, I was very smart and became an honor student in school. This translated to my parents as, “Oh so you can teach your sister.” So, now, I’m not only raising my little sister, but myself. My parents divorced when I was 10 years old, and quickly after the separation, my dad became physically abusive to me, and my mom lost her job and resorted to drugs. I began working for a family friend at 11 years old and was helping pay my mother's mortgage. Eventually, she lost the house to foreclosure. I was hospitalized multiple times, twice at 13, once at 14, and once at 15 for s*icide attempts and SH. I got another job legally at 14, and at 15, I basically hired a lawyer and ran away with my sister. We moved in with my grandmother across the country, and when I got there, I was a junior in high school with 8 credits and a 0.8 GPA. I had given up around 7th grade, and I worked my ASS OFF, and graduated with my full credit diploma, on time. I went to beauty school, I enrolled in college, and now I’m struggling with this. I seemed to be doing good, so I’m confused. 

Okay, so that's what I went through. Here is what I’m struggling with: 
My husband (yes I’m married, I know I’m young, I don’t wanna hear it please, we get judged enough.) is currently in basic training for the Army. I will admit that I am severely emotionally attached to him, I am very anxious and this is not a great thing for this situation. He left on February 4th, and since he left, my ability to eat has decreased. I am 5’2 and I weigh 120 LBS, however, this doesn't concern me. What concerns me is the fact that I weighed 132 when he left. I literally cannot physically force myself to eat. I’m so hungry but I sit down to eat and I take a bite and my immediate reaction is to throw up. I don’t know what to do :( I cry almost every day. AND PLEASE NOTE, I WANT TO EAT! I just want to enjoy food again. When this problem started, I had comfort foods that I could stomach, like chicken noodle soup, chicken pot pie, and chili. Now I can't even stomach 3 bites. 

my goal in posting this is hopefully to receive some insight into what this could possibly be or mean for me, and any guidance in the right direction to heal. Sorry for the essay, thank you!

I have very bad anxiety about, most things.....
Social anxiety, performance anxiety (im a musician) ect..
I also struggle with depression, i dont know what kind, but i think about suicide, like alot. Mostly jokingly lately, for example. 
""Oh i dont have to go do that thing if i kill myself lol"" idk, everything is very..... dull? When im low, colours are less bright, music doesnt hit the same, you know? 
Anyways 
Im with a new therapist so, yeah. But i dont see them again for another two weeks.
And everytime i try to think of someone to talk to i realize how alone i am, all my friends arent aware of my shit, my best friend is aware, but i feel like if i tell them ill exhaust them.
I dont want to hurt people and i feel their deep sadness, regret...
Just the raw horror whenever i talk about something like this even a little bit.
I dont want to be a burden. I dont want to exhaust the people i love.
Anyway, 

The point I came here to make, aka what tf the title is talking about
I havent been able to cry for...... a while? Im not sure how long, something similar happened a couple of years ago, but not like this, that was...... numb?
I feel this
It hurts so much.
Not like a physical pain, something sharp and demanding. Ive experienced that, ive had my palm ripped open! I know pain
Pain can be.... satisfying in a way. Your body telling you where the problem is, you resolve it and the pain goes away. Easy, simple. 
Its concise 
But this is...... worse
Its like this dull pain, and you cant find a place to pin it to so your brain just sits there in a corner, silent tears running down its face saying 
""........it hurts""
And i feel it
I feel it  _so much_ 
And i want to cry, and i start.
My eyes tear up, my lip quivers, the whole 9 yards
Then i smile
Involuntarily 
This horrible, massive grimace of a smile, all my teeth showing, mouth open
And i laugh, a small breathy chuckle. The kind you let out in relief but much less satisfying.
And i cant stop. I cant stop smiling without stopping the crying
And i do.
I push it down, the tears and the horrifying smile go away. But the pain doesn't 
Tears are how our bodies get rid of excess emotion and i cant FUCKING DO IT RIGHT
i have had a debilitating almost migraine like tension headache all day because of a deadline.
And i cannot cry
I am in an unbelievable amount of physical and mental pain and i can do nothing about it

Whats wrong with me? WHY AM I LIKE THIS!?
Im like the fucking joker lmao! wtf?!
I dont want to be like this. I just want to be fucking NORMAL
I WANT TO FEEL NORMAL
i want to hold a damn conversation without being anxious
Make a joke that isnt fucking depressing
I want to MOTHERFUCKING CRY
BUT I CANT
BECAUSE MY DUMBASS BRAIN IS BROKEN!!!!!

I want to fucking scream. But when you scream people ask what's wrong, and i know that they dont want to know. They want an awnser like i ""stepped in glass""
Not that i fantasize about walking into the ocean and not walking back out
Not that
Never that
No one wants to hear that.
What could they even do? Look at me differently? With sadness and pity? Maybe they could send me self help shit everyday that dont help, maybe they could hug me and cry because thats a fucking normal response, and make me feel awkward as shit.
Maybe they could treat me like a glass landmine.
Something that could explode with a misplaced breath.
Maybe they could stop talking to me. Because who needs a fucking burden in their lives? A liability? 
Not them.

i've been seeing various counselors, therapists, doctors, dieticians, etc since 2020. I've been seeing my current therapist for almost a year now.  She diagnosed me with binge eating disorder and depression, which I agree with

After several months she pushed me to try medication--I was hesitant because I was afraid that it would just make me less sad > less motivated to get better > increase my binge eating. Despite that, I agreed and have been on meds for over a month now. Guess what happened? Yeah

So after years of different approaches, counseling, self-help, CBT/DBT/etc, therapy, and now medication, i have made negative progress. I wish i could go back a few years to when i was still mentally ill but not as bad. All these years, and  I still have no idea what my triggers/causes are, it seems like everything and nothing will set me off. I've told all this to my therapists, doctors, etc but don't really get a concrete response

I have a full-time job and rent my own apartment, I don't have the money or time to go to some inpatient facility (i am very leery of eating disorder inpatient places anyway). I'm trying to join support groups but there's nothing in-person in my area and i struggle with stupid zoom calls with people that i cant relate much to

i'm so close to just giving up and letting the worst in me take over. I don't know where else to find strength. (I am religious so please don't tell me to turn to God, I am don't worry) I know change has to come from inside myself but it feels like the parasite in me is bigger than I am and I've already lost.

I am a mentally ill 28M who is neurodivergent (ADHD), severe anxiety/ocd, and I suspect CPTSD as well. When I get crushes, a trigger flips in my head and all in this internal chaos comes out.

I get super overwhelmed and anxious, mood swings, crying spells, can barely interact with said person and things eventually become weird. I all of a sudden become very attached and clingy, and I start overthinking everything. I lose my mind by wondering whether the signs or real or if I am just crazy. 

I have never been able to make moves on girls, and many of them seem to take it personally and resent me for it. They cold or become passive aggressive. 

This has been going on for more than a decade, and I just don’t know how to deal with this anymore. Other guys who were terrible with girls have figured it out, and I just keep going downhill.

The only times I have been able to make it work is when I was prescribed on heavy cocktail of meds and even then I had to ask her out over text because I couldn’t handle it.

Brother asked me to help him deal with his psychotic wife

Hello,

There's a TL;DR at the bottom. 

My brother lives with his wife and her 15 year old son. About 2 or 3 months ago she began to experience paranoid delusions with auditory hallucinations. She thought there were cameras watching her in a particular room she spent time in. It began centralized in that single room but eventually branched out to the entire house. 

Over time, she had developed these conspiracy theories that CPS was stalking her and would take her son away. She believes there is a federal case against her. She has called the police, the FBI, and lawyers. The police gave my brother information on government mental health programs but she refuses to go because she believes they're out to get her. She will say that she's willing to get a psych evaluation but always has an excuse not to go when he brings it up. 

This weekend the situation has become more serious. My brother drove her to another city so she could take care of her father, who was recently diagnosed with late stage cancer. He found her climbing into the attic with his samurai sword trying to find some device she believed was monitoring her. He tried to take it from her and things got violent. The cops were called and her poor father was arrested. My brother picked her up and took her back home. 

She's now there being a total wreck. She won't do anything to help herself. She won't contribute. He has to do everything by himself and he's becoming far too strained. He's asked for me help in dealing with her. 

You should know that we all suspect her of abusing drugs. She has a history of drug abuse and does not have very much self control. The drugs I know she used in the past include meth and air dusters. Whippets. THC. I don't know about any others. Meth would certainly explain these symptoms. But my brother has seen no evidence. No smells. She may be eating the meth. But he doesn't know how she could be getting it. At this point it might be possible the extended drug abuse has caused permanent psychosis. I've seen that in other people. But I'm not a mental health professional. I'm a former addict and alcoholic. So I know quite a bit about drug abuse. And I've been around a lot of people with various afflictions. 

What advice can I relay to my brother in how to deal with her? How can he convince her to get a psych evaluation? He doesn't want to kick her out. 

TL;DR: My brother's wife has psychosis, paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations, conspiracy theories, and is a danger to herself, her son, and my brother. What can I do to help them? What advice can I relay to him? 

Thank you. ",My brother asked me to help him with his wife who is suffering from paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations.,1741723783.0,1j90ael

I’m done with dating. I have the unlucky circumstance of being gay. So the dating pool is already small. And also finding someone who cares about building a future and a relationship with someone (a committed monogamous relationship) doesn’t seem like it exists in this community. I get called “old fashioned” for not wanting to be in an open relationship and subjecting myself to hook up culture. I’m done because no one wants what I want. Been out of the closet and dating for about 6 years. Most people just wanna fuck, the rest act like they want a relationship until they’re just bored of it and call it quits.
 Everyone just lets me down. And it makes me really sad. I have had 4 relationships in the past few years where I grew to deeply care about people just to never see them again at some point. And it makes me suicidal.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello everyone, I need your help/advice. Sorry if it is long/confusing but English isn’t my native language.

So I (28F) live in a small town in a country in Europe. I grew up here, I always lived here. I never liked it, not the landscape, nor really the work/life balance etc. I have been thinking about moving for a while now, but for several (mostly economic reasons) I am still stuck here.
Now I am kinda at the point where either I move now or I make it work here, although I know that I don’t enjoy it. 

Here, I live in my small apartment at home, in the same building as my family but separate from them. Its nice, although not a place I see myself live in for more than some more years. I have a job offert here that might be interesting, but just compared to other jobs here, so not really something too exciting, just better than most alternatives. I have very few friends, not really any reasons to stay here other than comfort zone (although uncomfortable). I don’t enjoy my life, I just make it through the day. 

Now I kinda have an opportunity to move in a different country, where a good friend of mine lives. She offered me a job, although not a lot of hours/nor good pay. 
Thing is, its really hard to find an apartment in the area where she lives, and those that are available are very expensive. I don’t speak the language (yet) so thats also an issue, although most people speak English as a second language.

My problem is that my mental health isnt good at all, I keep thinking that I want to move, and when I start looking I get discouraged immediately, because of the difficulty in finding a place/moving, and most of all, because I don’t know if I would even like it there! I have been there twice on holiday and I really liked it, but if course thats different than moving there.
I know that probably its just laziness/fear of getting out of the comfort zone, but I dont find the energy to do so, because I know that I will have to settle for what I find in terms of job/apartment in the beginning. I would have to move with my 2 pets, which is also a big problem in terms of costs/logistics/finding a place, as well as losing my current apartment to my younger brother.

I think that my main issue is getting out into the comfort zone into the unknown scares me out more than it excites me! Anyone has been through something similar/has any tips on how to get out of the comfort zone?

MentalHealthSupport,"I haven't posted on Reddit before and I don't really know where to start with this or what to include. I know I should be seeking support from a therapist but I can't access one at the moment. but I'll start with the issue that has lead me to be make this post... 

I am 21 Female. living at home with my parents and younger brother. For a long time now I have struggled getting out of bed in the morning and leaving my room when I can hear people in the house. It gives me severe anxiety and as soon as I emerge my room I instantly try not to make eye contact, get agitated waiting for them to speak to me and then become deeply frustrated when they do. It's to the point where I don't get out of bed until the afternoon when I realise I am never going to get a chance to get out of bed with no one home and the whole day is nearly gone or I have to get up for work or I'll be late. So every day I walk past as quickly as possible, give a quick hi with my head down if they talk to me and speed walk into the bathroom where I sit in the bottom of the  shower for an hour trying to pull myself together and also try to figure out why I am like this.

 Some mornings I can't push past it especically when I'm forced to talk more than my usual ""hi"". I try to get ready as quickly as possible and strategicly as possible to not have to make eye contact or speak with anyone but this is quite a hard task as my house only has 5 rooms and my dad is often sitting in the  room located right outside my bedroom door so by the time I leave the house I'm an anxious mess. I don't know why I feel this way. I haven't always been like this. There are alot of ideas I've come up with that could be contributing factors but none that feel like enough of a reason to behave like this. I feel like a piece of shit. I don't want to treat my parents this way. Especially my dad who is kind to me and is only trying to say good morning. 

A one theory I have is it that I am becoming non verbal in the morning which is a common trait of autism (which I am not diagnosed with but am sure I have// my brother was diagnosed severely autistic as a child and is partially non verbal. He is 20 years old now and has learnt to say a few sentences that make sense mixed with alot of gibberish phrases.) 

Second theory is it may have developed over the past few years... Before my dog Lilly, a  16year old english Staffordshire passed away in January she was old and suffering from cancer. Her whole life my brother had pestered her by sitting on her, pulling her ears and tail, pinching her but she was the sweetest thing and never fought back. I tried to defend her as much as possible, especially as she got older and developed a cancerous lesion on her tail which my brother wouldn't stop touching with dirty hands and making it  infected. He also often has tantrums and would run into my room  while me and Lilly were asleep in bed and try to pinch her or hurt her in some way so I learnt to constantly listen to everything as I sleep and spring up to defend lilly instantly whenever I heard footsteps near my room or hear my door open. I wonder if the habit of this contributes to why I lay there anxiously listening but it would only explain fear of my brother. 

My mother has meltdowns herself occasionally but never tries to hurt me not did she try to hurt Lilly when she was alive. She lives in a van now and comes and goes when she likes but when I was a child and she lived in the house with us she would wake up every day and start yelling, throwing things around and slamming doors usually because there was mess she didn't like (toys on the floor, dishes not done, laundry) so alot of my childhood was spent walking in egg shells. My mum was an alcoholic and spent all of her time either at the pub, throwing up in the bathroom or yelling at us for the house not being the way she wanted. 

My dad is an amazing man. He did everything for me and my brother growing up and still continues to now. He cares for my brother full time and would do anything for me but I still feel this resentment towards him and I don't understand why. In the morning he is the person I avoid the most (possibly because he is the hardest to avoid?)and I don't understand why. Maybe it's because of his judgmental nature. Often criticizing people who aren't as mentally strong as him and need drugs and alcohol to cope, calling them selfish (I personally use weed to cope with all I've been through in life. I experienced some quite traumatic event in my early teens. I was groomed by a 21 year old crackhead who I ended up living with for a year at age 13 who abused me in countless ways) 
My dad also palms me off when I try to tell him I think I'm autistic or have other mental health issues which makes it really hard to connect with him emotionally. 

As much as I feel I have answered my own question here I still don't feel satisfied with my answers. I feel like I'm just whinging. Why do I feel these emotions. I know my life isn't that bad and my dad is such as amazing man. He's done so much for me and I can tell he's worried about me since I've been so closed off and often breaking down into tears as I'm leaving home. I don't understand why I struggle to talk to him lately. Whenever I am home I just have this feeling inside me like I'm going to explode out of my skin.

MentalHealthSupport,"I’m transgender (FtM), and have happily been transgender for quite a while. However, sometimes, I deeply regret my choice, but it’s not ME who regrets it. I genuinely feel like the little girl who was me when I was a child is still in my head as a separate being, and I am my own separate being. I hear her speak to me sometimes, mainly when she’s frustrated with something I’m doing, such as smoking for example. I also sometimes hear and “see” a boy in my head who isn’t me, he almost seems like he’s protective over the little girl me? I say “see” because it’s almost like this vague mental image. For a while I thought it was just my kind playing tricks on me but it won’t go away, both of them communicate through my thoughts with me and I cannot control them for the most part. It feels real. I know I do not have DID or anything because I don’t experience dissociative amnesia, and I don’t feel as if I am dissociating when I hear them and such. Does anyone else experience this? How does it make you feel? Have you found any coping mechanisms for when it makes you feel insane? Thank you for reading.  I just don’t want to feel so alone and crazy.

MentalHealthSupport,"I was raised by my mom pretty much cause dad was an addict and narc. In my eyes, she was the only person who cared for me. I knew I had daddy issues but recently I kinda feel like I'm less of a woman, I don't know what I should do as a woman, i dont have friends. I don't know my value and my husband often hints that I'm not raised well. While my mom was hustling trying to put food on our table, she was rarely involved in raising me. She pretty much neglected me emotionally and never guided me in life. It's as if she had zero expectations of me. She always say, do what you love. That's it. I would do all things to make her feel proud, but she was too busy to validate my success.To start with, she had walls around her so I didn't know what exactly she felt or what mistakes she did cause she portrayed herself to be perfect. She would take abuse from dad and didn't fight back until I was an adult. It was my siblings that taught me bits and pieces of life but they were toxic too, so that broke my self esteem.

MentalHealthSupport,"I’ve been verbally abused by one of my parents. And a little bit physically but not a lot. It’s no longer going on anymore but did for years when I was younger. I have a feeling I have also experienced sexual trauma but I don’t know how sure. I don’t have much evidence I just have a feeling that I have and I’ve noticed some weird things about me over the years.
I’ve always been hyper sexual since I was younger. I remember that I used to see things on the tv that heavily implied sexual topics and I became kind of obsessed with it and the idea of sex. I was snuggling with the parent that verbally abused me on the couch a year or so ago and they put their hand on my lower hip and I felt uncomfortable. They didn’t respect my boundaries sand just got mad that I kept loving their hand. I don’t know why I did. I’ve been uncomfortable with my family seeing my body for years. I often feel uncomfortable with the thought of people possibly thinking of me sexually. When I got my first period (age 14)  I automatically thought that one parent did something to me before I even thought it was my period. I’ve had an irrational fear from a condition I have but I don’t know if what I thought when I got my period was an irrational fear or a sign that something did happen to me sexually. I also had an encounter with a future pedophile when I was a preteen. When I found out he liked me I felt very uncomfortable and cut him off. It’s been years and he is an adult now and still liking little girls. I’m scared of him even though I don’t recall anything sexual or really inappropriate happening. We only communicated through text as we met through a mutual friend. I’ve always had a thought/feeling when I’m around a lot of men that they like me sexually and I start feeling uncomfortable when I don’t even have any proof to that. I don’t have any memory of being sexually abused but I don’t know if it’s just other things I’ve experienced that are causing these symptoms/feelings or what.

MentalHealthSupport,"Last year In July I (17F) hit my younger brother (13m). He called me stupid after I did, and I hit him in the stomach. I’ve never reacted that fast, I wasn’t thinking at all. I never want to hurt him or anyone else, the thought makes me sick. I don’t think it was hard and my mum has asked him about it and he’s said it didn’t upset or hurt him at all, but ever since then I’ve been so scared that I’m an abuser. I don’t know what to believe. My mother doesn’t see me as an abuser and so do other people in my previous posts but I don’t want the only explanation people have for me not being an abuser to be that I care. I’ve always known it’s wrong to take your anger out on anyone and as a kid when my brother would intentionally annoy me, I’d always try really really hard not to hurt him and instead would run off to my room. My mother and brother don’t believe it’s a pattern of behaviour and he says he hasn’t ever been scared of me. 

I know that many victims of abuse don’t recognise they’re a victim for many years so I’m scared that this is the case for him and one day he’ll confront me saying that I’m his abuser. 

Hitting a few times would be understandable if I was a toddler or very young child, but I’m SEVENTEEN. For me to hit someone I’d have to be severely emotionally immature. My father definitely has been, he’s always been emotionally/mentally abusive to me mostly and my siblings. But I don’t believe this has impacted my behaviour, it’s affected my self esteem but I’d still have a choice on how I act. I’ve read alot about emotional immaturity and it doesn’t sound like me at all. I take responsibility for my actions, apologise, I’m flexible, aware of my emotions and the emotions of others, honest, open-minded and able to forgive others easily. I haven’t been the most mature in the past but I still don’t feel as if it matches to the level where I’d resort to violence. I don’t think I’m perfect whatsoever, I don’t want to defend myself or my actions and I have no intention to manipulate anyone. I’m not saying what I did was accidental, just that it feels like it was because of how fast I reacted.

I need to know If I’m an abuser. If it was a pattern of behaviour would I be one? I’m unsure if there has been one or not, I’d greatly appreciate if someone could tell me if there is one or not.

When I’m around him i don’t feel as if I have to control myself at all. I don’t feel angry often in general and when I do around him, I have no urges to hurt him or anyone else. Both him and my mum think I’m making a big deal out of nothing, he wasn’t hurt at all and since then I have apologised, but anytime someone mentions abuse I feel terrified that I’m that type of person. I know many people dismiss abuse between siblings because it’s “just sibling rivalry” so I don’t want to do that. We have a five year age gap and he hasn’t ever hurt me back, (unlike the relationship between him and our sister who are much closer). I read stories of women who have been hit just once by their boyfriend in a relationship and have been told that their partner is an abuser, I agree. Would this mean I’m an abuser because in both scenarios, there isn’t a pattern of aggressive behaviour?

My brother says other than that he can’t remember me doing anything else like this other than saying something mean once or twice and appearing really angry and making faces. I’ve had images in my head of me punching and pinching him from when I was younger my mum asked him if he could remember a specific “memory” I was imagining from 2-3 years ago and he couldn’t recall it at all. This makes me think it was very likely a false memory, I felt angry at the time and stopped myself from hurting him which is why my ocd chose that image specifically. Everyone says I’ve always been kind and careful not to hurt anyone, we’ve never really fought unlike him and our sister who have a lot. I tend to imagine events a lot worse than they actually were.

I need to know if I’m an abuser or not so I can decide whether to kill myself or not. Please don’t lie to me to protect my feelings.

I also remember two years ago he was always taking people’s things and not listening to anyone and then he took my popcorn and I got mad and I said “what’s wrong with you”. I was focusing more on how he’d been acting but I clearly went about it  wrong. I apologised an hour later and he says I didn’t make him feel like that but it still upset him because he’d been feeling that way because he didn’t have many friends. Anytime he’s asked if he’s felt hurt by me he thinks it’s ridiculous that I’m thinking that. ",TW  I want to die from the thought of being an abuser,1741766806.0,1j9f3vk

MentalHealthSupport,"I am just so confused and exhausted. I am a 14 year old girl and i am just so tired of everything. I have always had problems and arguments with my mum but now im just done. Let me explain everything from recently.

I am struggling with talking, like at all sometimes, as i seem to just not being able to speak or verbalise words when spoken or questioned about anything. It doesn't happen all the time but happens a lot. When i am forced to speak i just feel like i want to break down and cry, self harm as i have done many times before because of this and just get more and more non verbal. I don't know why i do think but i just feel too tired to speak or socialise at all.  I have sensory issues which prevent me from hugging or showing any physical touch or contact, for example the type or feel of shirt someone wears, how their hair feels and even how someone smells. Eye contact its also very hard for me sometimes and also stimming certain words that linger in my mind or what someone says. I also struggle to make friends and i dont really understand others and their emotions or feelings.

Now on to why i'm exhausted and just done.  My mum and i have never been on great terms due to her lack of understanding and not even trying to understand the way i act and why. A couple weeks ago her and i started to have a semi argument about all the stuff i do and why. I have tried countless time trying to explain to her why i do all these thing but honestly its like trying to talk to a brick wall as all she does is get mad. The semi argument ended with her telling me i must have a mental block of somesort and need to see the school guidance counsellor. The next day i did go to the guidance counsellor and had a deep chat with her. After the talk she had stared to explain how everything i have been saying is not something she knows much about but does suspect of Autism and suggests i talk to my family doctor about it. She also said that it would be wise if i talk to my mum about it but i asked if she could call my mum instead. The guidance cousellor and my mum have a long talk and everything is fine. After school my mum was all chappy and happy with what she had heard on the phone has she said it gave her more insight and understanding of everything. I thought that would be the end of it but no. After a week or so she went straight back to normal and had arguments and started saying that i probably don/t even have autism and just stuff like that. So like what is even the reason for anything anymore? So hopefully next monday i get answer so whatever i have gets through my mums thick skull because i feel like if i actually get diagnosed with it then hopefully she would actually try understand and get a grip.

As perceiving that everything is temporary.
That is the most reasonable answer for me about life so far.
Otherwise there’s too much pain and it doesn’t make sense.



Everything is pain if you see that way.
And everything is love if you see that way.
No ways are wrong.
Any ways you see, you’ll learn something.

Well, we are particles of this universe so in some sense they already exist.

MentalHealthSupport,"Okay. This isn’t me trying to be cringe or corny— I’d appreciate some kind of explanation or answer or even help as to why im like this and how i can fix it

For context: Im 15. I grew up in an abusive household (Abusive in every way you can think of, even the ones you don’t WANT to think of)

Since I was 9-10 years old, i’ve noticed i’m extremely violent. It doesn’t always bubble over into anger, but it’s always there in the corner of my mind and I can’t see,cto get rid of it. Especially with authority figures and vulnerable people/things, not that it doesn’t happen to regular people. It restricts my behaviour sometimes and I’ve never significantly hurt anything but i’ve come close. My niece is now 5, I find myself distanced with her at times because i’m afraid I’ll lose control and hurt her. When she was younger I would hold her at times and even when she got fussy i’d refuse to let go because I liked seeing her squirm or be upset in a way? (101% Not sexual. I’m not a creep.) And just seeing her be mad and upset or even cry for some reason brought me a sense of satisfaction. I stopped holding her and playing with her after realizing this fact. It’s the same with my sister’s boyfriend’s cat, I love playing with him but sometimes I find that I tease him until he’s so angry that he wants to or does bite me.

I often find myself imaging violent scenarios. And it’s not like I enjoy violence. I grew up in a violent household and have CPTSD at 15, I’d never abuse anyone or get into a relationship if I couldn’t handle myself but i’m just not sure why this happens to me or how to fix it.

MentalHealthSupport,"I'm not really sure how this works or where to start. I guess I could start with I was the type of kid that always got into trouble. I had a tough childhood where I would be in a household with my older brother (19) (I'm 18m), mom and dad until I was about 4. Where there was drugs and alcohol and abuse. For example one of the reasons my mom and dad broke up was cause he would leave me and my brother home alone at 4 and 5 years old with some chips and soda where he would do meth, coke, weed, drink u name it. My stepdad met my mom within a few years after that and have been together since. He is a terrible man. He started grooming me and my older brother to have sex with him when we were about 5 and 6. He would do it while me and my family would go and work on carnivals, he drove the 18 wheelers and had me and my brother ride with him. We have 4 younger siblings ranging from 6 to 10 atm. Because of my childhood and as I mentioned before, I've always gotten into trouble. When I was younger (around 12), I did something that I feel disgusted with myself for. I'm not trying to make excuses and I won't ever forgive myself for it. But because of what my stepdad did to me, I though it was something that I could do with my younger siblings. I can never forgive myself for it. Ive tried killing myself 3 time because of what I did. But I wasn't never brave enough to do it. My sibling told my mom and I was sent off to a mental facility for people like me. I was there for about 8 months and came home. Its been about 5 years and I haven't felt at home since. After about a year of me being with my mom, I got sent to Julie for acting out and was there for two weeks. By the time I got back mh family had moved and my mom got I to contact with my bio father to live with him. Me and him don't really get along at all. I lived with him from 13 years old to about 16, where he moved off and joined a carnie and left me with his mom. I had to ride in a 2 door truck in between the back glass and the truck seat for about an hour to and from school everyday cause my meme (dad's mom) didn't want me going to the school where she lived. I stayed there for a few months and was 16. In May of 23 I ran away at 16 but got caught in 2 days. They took me back to my memes and she and my dad got contacted by a random stranger off Facebook saying that they were out looking for me cause they saw the Facebook post and said if they need help with anything just ask. I got I to a heated argument with my meme and she called the lady (Her name was Dora). She told her that if she did t co e pick me up then she was gonna call the cops and tell them I was trespassing and get me thrown in jail. Dora had to leave a funeral just so she could get there in time so I didn't go to jail. We'll as soon as I went with Dora, she immediately went to the social security office and got my check going into her account( I'm getting SSI and my dad told her about it, and she was also telling me that there was no info on the check or when I was gonna get it)( if u live in the US then u know how bad communication with the Social Security Office is). She was telling me lies about my family like they robbed a gas station and that the person that robbed it was wearing the same shoes my family gave me. (My mom gave me some shoes when she found me after I ran away). She said my siblings got took fro. My mom by CPS and that if I helped her clean the house that CPS was coming by to see if the house was suitable for children. (I turned 17 while living with Dora). She said this multiple times and they never came. She had this rule about no drugs in the house but she was the biggest tweaker u could find. She would stay up ALL NIGHT paranoid about people being outside the house. She would drag me outside at 1 and 2 am looking for ""my mom's truck"" cause they were apparently riding around looking for where Dora lived. She kept saying she was seeing my mom around town. Mind u my parents lived over 3 hours away. She even went into Walmart and came out with a black eye saying my dad attacked her in the store when in reality she got I to a fight over a bag of dog food with a stranger. I was emotionally checked out and I don't really remember a lot during that time and was easily manipulated. While living with Dora, I met Shelby. When we met we just clicked. We had a lot in commen and I felt comfortable sharing things with her then anyone I've ever met. She was the first person I ever wanted to spend the rest of my life with. She meant the world to me. The last day I was with Dora, I had had enough, cause at that point I started to notice some of the thi gs Dora said hadn't been lining up. I got I to contact with my mom and found out that 1, my siblings gs never gotten took by CPS 2, nobody robbed any store and 3, Dora was a manipulative bitch. I told my mom where I was and she came to get me. The mistake I made was that I did t talk to Shelby and discuss it with her. I never told her about what I did when I was younger cause I was scared to. Well Dora decides she wants to tell Shelby that I'm a rapist that went around my neighborhood and raped multiple people. I tell her that it's true what I did to my sibling, but not about anyone else. She didn't believe me cause Dora also stashed a bag of weed under the couch and Shelby found it, and Dora told her it was mine. I tell her that she'll find out the truth one day about Dora. We'll I'm living g with my mom at that point until we get into an argument and I get kicked out. I started staying with my exs family cause me and them were still pretty close. Well my ex had a new bf and he didn't like me staying there and ignored me the whole time I lived there. Well after a few months my exs friend Marley stays the night with my ex. And I sleep in the living room on the couch right. We'll Marley decides to co.e I to the living room at like 1 am right before my exs grandma gets off work and starts talking to me cause I was on my phone. She goes into her room after 30 min and I lay down. I'm still awake about 10 min later when my exs Granma pulls up, comes I to the house and causes me of sleeping with Marley. I did not do that, she's my distant family anyway. (Found that out that same night.) Anyway tye next day I got kicked out and moved in with my mom sleeping in a camper in the yard. About a month later I decided to move in with my uncle that lives 9 hours away and moved in with him. It was a mistake. Me and his gf did NOT get along. I stayed there for about 8 or 9 months and moved back to my mom's town. I now live with my other uncle and older brother. I have no job, no car, no gf, no live other than my friends on my playstation 4. Ive been looking for a job for months now and I can't find someone to care about me the same way that Shelby did. I just feel so alone and dark. Ive been thinking g about just ending it all so everyone will be happy. I mean my own brother said it would be better if I wasn't here and maybe he's right. I mean I deserve it for what I've done. Ive done horrible things and I just can't forgive myself. I dont know how much longer I can take this darkness. I can't find the light.

It was a great relationship and eventually we got married. I’m not sure what went so south, but he started drinking more, became controlling and eventually started getting physical. I felt numb and my self confidence went down.
I did however find the strength to leave as much as it broke my heart, I had to do what I thought was best. 
After I left, the mental abuse didn’t stop. Again, I felt numb.  Last August we got into a fight and he told me he hated me and he shot himself that night. The cops called me and I was the first person to arrive. My heart felt shattered all over again.

I guess I just feel so guilty, heart broken and again numb. I crave to be happy so much. Our daughters deserve that and so do I.

MentalHealthSupport,"I 21F was diagnosed with chronic depression, anxiety when I was 11. I also had very severe unalive ideations. When this happened, both my parents immediately made sure I got as much support as possible in all forms. Therapy, home-life, meds, ect. They have always been as vigilant and supportive as possible with me, and I have always been greatful for that. 

My sister, 25F also suffers from chronic anxiety and other mental disorders that I will not relay here out of respect for her privacy. She was diagnosed a little later than I was, around 19F, and my mom has provided little support with things such as therapy or meds. Infact, whenever my sister brings up her mental struggles, my mom either becomes dismissive or irritated. This truly shocks me because she was so supportive with me, and it hurts to see her to this do this to my siblings. 

Her standards with us when it comes to mental health are so different. With me, she is lenient on things such as college, energy levels, and even routines. With my sister, she becomes very impatient if my sister is not doing things exactly the way she expects. An example of this is that my mom does not allow anyone in the house to take showers after 10:30 pm, because both parents are going to bed at that time and showers can be loud and interrupt sleep. Sometimes my sister gets into episodes where she has no motivation to do any tasks during the day, including showering. Whenever my sister needs to take a shower after this time, my mom gets upset with her and admonishes her for it. On the other hand, if I am having an off day and find myself taking a shower at 12 am, my mother never gets upset or angry. 

That was only one example of many I could provide, but I will only provide that one just to get my point across. 

I honestly feel like I am the reason that my sister isn’t getting the support or care she needs. I feel like a big leech sucking up all of the resources for myself when I don’t even see myself having a future! It’s so unfair that my sister isn’t getting the support she needs and deserves. She’s going to be a very successful person in her life, and I am not. All of this care I am receiving should be given to her. I feel awful.

MentalHealthSupport,"To start, I have diagnosed OCD, ADHD, and depression by a professional. 

At work, I am often seen as a “problem solver” or “analytical” because I find issues before they arise by asking a lot of questions. 

At home, those same actions get viewed as combative or argumentative. 

For example, if a peer suggests I do something differently with my work project, I will often pick it apart. Not in a way to try to be rude or dismissive, but to see if there are any flaws in the plan. Then I move from there. I have never been a “Hey you! Do this thing” and I just say “ok” type of person. There are typically several follow up questions. 

I can see why my partner finds these actions to be combative. I would probably be frustrated too if I was helping my partner in a game and every time I told them to do something they asked me why and they got into a back and forth with me about it. 

I just don’t know how to stop it. I’m not trying to be difficult or argumentative. I don’t know how to just accept it when he says, “you need to do this quest next” or tries to correct my running form (something I have asked him to do) and I don’t argue back or immediately get upset.

MentalHealthSupport,"I’m not a lazy person, but I find it incredibly hard to push myself to work and do something significant. My entire conscious life, I have been completely dependent on my family, who provided for my education and everything else. I never really had a childhood—no socializing with other kids, no freedom—just endless studying and activities I hated, which drained every part of me.

I was always burdened with extreme responsibility, so I never experienced my teenage years the way I should have. My life felt like an endless hell of suffering, and it seemed like it would never end.

Then, someone came into my life. Someone who had almost nothing but still pulled me out of that hell—at the cost of their own health and personal life. They took me under their wing, helped me in every possible way. But in the end, we both ended up trapped. We had an agreement: in return for all this help, we would work together on a major project.

But I kept resisting. I was so exhausted from working like crazy and being torn between two extremes: staying in the familiar pain or stepping into something new, knowing there would be no turning back. And now, for over a year, we haven’t been actively working on anything. I haven’t brought in a single cent or a single client—though I’ve created incredible designs, marketing materials, and more.

My resistance comes from my fear of independence, my fear of taking responsibility for myself. I have no addictions, except for one—I endlessly eat and waste my energy on meaningless social interactions. No one knows what I’m really going through. I realize that I’m behaving like a parasite, like a child who refuses to grow up. But after years of endless suffering, moving toward success and independence feels unbearably painful.

For a little while now I have had trouble regulating my emotions when talking to my partner. Whenever she is upset or talking with me about her mental health, I find it really difficult not to break down too and it usually ends up with me crying and her having to care for me. When that happens I really can't be there for her properly and that puts pressure on her to reassure me and take care of me, when I just really want to be present and listen to her. I love her so so much and I just get so overwhelmed and worried about her when we have these discussions and i just want her to feel well. Its such a terrifying feeling not be able to help really when she's not feeling well mentally and I just want to solve it for her. I want her to not have to worry about taking care of me when we have these moments. Just wondering if anyone has some advice or tools I can use to greater control my emotions in these instances or has experiences a similar thing, it would be greatly appreciated!

I have lost a lot of my confidence and motivation through these years and am struggling to feel good. It has reached to the point where I don’t really like getting out of bed or going outside, not been looking after my hygiene or enjoy doing the activity I usually love doing. 

I believe I started feeling like this due to university, a declining social life and confidents and stress for the future. 

I started university in 2022 and hopefully graduate this year. I haven’t enjoyed uni from the start because of the lack of friends I had, even when I tried to put myself out , I didn’t get anywhere (which confused me because I’ve never had a problem making friends). This continued throughout 2nd and 3rd year.
I’ve also lost interest in my course which is post   Production in film, I’ve had editing and colour grading as a hobby and university has killed it for me. Instead, i feel stupid and worthless every time I step onto the campus, considering I stay late nights (10am -10pm) to small task done just to find out my course mates are further ahead and getting better grades. This has killed my enjoyment for pproduction and now I am not sure what I want to do in life.

I have lost my confidence due to the fact that I am kinda tired being a push over with the friends I have at home. I’m at not trying to be a victim, but I think I get picked on a lot. I believe it’s because I have done a lot of stupid and childish things in my past. I use let insults slide and stuff. I do not know if I am over exaggerating or if I am being delusional but I feel like it has come to the point where I feel like I am hanging out with people that don’t like me,I just laugh it off and playfully react.

Me (F, 20) started working as a behavioral technician in September, and during my last shift, a coworker reported me to my supervisor for not filling out a sheet—even though I was planning to fill it out before I left. Then, a nurse escalated things even more, threatening to report me to HR because I sat in the “wrong” place (even though the person I was working with said it was okay) and didn’t know something I was never trained on.

When I tried to talk to the nurse to clear things up, she completely dismissed me and said, “This is the third time I’ve had to talk to you,” which isn’t even true—I’ve always listened to her without hesitation. To make it worse, she and my coworker were talking about me behind my back, making me feel singled out.

Thankfully, my supervisor told the nurse that this wasn’t something that needed to be reported to HR, but at this point, I feel really uncomfortable working with her. I don’t want to deal with her again, and I feel like what happened should at least be known.

I recently quit out of feeling overwhelmed, although I had planned on leaving after March. I decided to expedite my resignation, and many of my coworkers texted me saying they would miss me. I hate that I let these women get to me this much, and I miss the patients.

He’s desperately in love with the main character’s love interest, to the point where he’s written an insanely long and detailed self-insert fanfic of himself with her that he forced me to read.

I feel like this kind of thing wouldn’t be super concerning if it wasn’t for his depression? Idk if I’m right to feel that way or not. Since he graduated high school last year, he’s lost communication with (and honestly interest in) all of our friends (I’m not friends with them anymore either but I digress, that’s for separate reasons). My best friend and I are all he’s got, and she doesn’t even like him much. None of my friends do, and honestly sometimes I question if I still do. But I still care about him a lot, and I don’t want anything to happen to him, if that makes sense.

He’s been better until recently. When we were in high school, he was at his worst, and he’d constantly talk about this anime girl and the world she’s from and how he’d “kill himself in a heartbeat if it meant getting to live there with her”, which is obviously concerning. It got even worse when he learned what reality shifting was, if anyone here knows what that is. Recently, he’s been talking to me more about it, and it’s freaking me out. It just makes me super uncomfortable to talk about these topics. Like yeah, I’ve had crushes on characters before, but this just feels like a lot.

He’s just been super clingy, and while I understand needing someone, I just can’t be his only support. I’m also struggling with depression right now, and still being in high school isn’t helping at all. I’m also just a teenager, too? I’m not a mental health professional, I can’t fix his problems.

Speaking of mental health professionals, he outright refuses to see one. He said that he didn’t like therapy, that it didn’t help him, and he even brought up that he apparently spent some time in a mental hospital because of it, which I feel says more about him than the therapy. I told him that maybe he just didn’t like his therapist, but he shuts that down every time. I understand that maybe he could’ve felt like they thought he was nuts, but that’s probably because that’s how I feel sometimes when I’m talking to him. This stuff is constant. He’s the kind of friend that latches on and doesn’t let go, which is even worse for me because I’m extremely introverted, and he has a very draining personality to boot. He’s just super loud and energetic, which can be hard for me to handle for long periods of time.

Look, if I just need to suck it up, I’ll do it. The last thing I want is for him to hurt himself, and if I have to be the sole support, so be it. He means a lot to me for a lot of different reasons. He’s always stuck with me through everything I’ve experienced, and I just want to do what I can to help him get better. I’m just worried that he’s deteriorating again, but I don’t want to cause any rifts between us, either. I’ve never dealt with this kind of thing before, so I don’t really know what to do here.",My friend is struggling with mental illness and I don’t know what to do,1741596690.0,1j7u91c

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello

English isn't my mother language so I'm sorry if it isn't perfect or clear all the time, I'll just try my best 

I'm a 25 yo male. A week ago my girlfriend (21 yo) and I broke up. We were together for the past 3 years and I thought we built a strong relationship during this time but there was a problem. One of my best friends didn't know about my relationship because she hated my girlfriend. 
I tried many times to talk to her but I never had the courage to do it... Until one month ago I was forced to do it to save my relationship. My girlfriend couldn't stand the situation anymore and... I gather all my courage and said the truth to my best friend. She was really upset but she accepted it.

From this moment my girlfriend started to be... Weird with me. She was less with me and more with her friends, saying she needed to take some time for herself to feel better, we used to call everyday before and talk about everything but during this last months it was like she was trying to... Flee our relationship... Until one week ago were she broke up with me.

She said that she ""lost"" feeling, that's she was less in love with me. she also said she couldn't trust me, despite I gave her reasons to, that she wasn't seeing any evolution in our relationship (even if she wasn't really here to see those evolutions). I hold the relationship by myself during this last month and her reasons was a total nonsense for me, we were planning to gather some money to live together in our own apartment, we were trying to build our futur life together. I gave her what she needed because I was sure of us, she used to say that I'm the man of her life, the one she want to spend the rest of her life with.. And now I'm alone and she refuse to explain herself more., she blocked me almost everywhere. My two closest friends think that it's really weird the way she acted during the last month, like she was preparing our breakup. I also know that during this period she was spending a lot of time with her best friend but.. I can't imagine her cheating on me, I don't think she did it.

I don't really know what to think of it. I try no move on but it's too hard, I wanted to live my life with her but now I'm completely lost and I feel like there's something I don't know. 

I know I acted bad when I hide my relationship to my best friend. I was afraid to lose everyone... But I ended up revealing the truth and despite that I lost the woman I love... I really need help. Is it understandable for you? Was she right to flee the relationship during this last month while I was trying my best to think about our future life and how to achieve it?",Breakup after 3 years,1741596802.0,1j7u9we

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi everyone, I'm new to this group, so please bear with me.

I strongly suspect my mom has depression and possibly PTSD, but she refuses to acknowledge that she has a problem or seek help. She insists that others are the problem, not her.

My mom is 67 years old and has been battling trauma and emotional distress since getting married at 24. According to her, her mother-in-law (MIL) emotionally abused her and made snarky comments, while my father, a workaholic and alcoholic, sided with his mother and did little to support their marriage. Most of this happened before I was born in 1988, so I only know her side of the story.

In the early 1990s, my father asked for a divorce, which my mom believes was suggested by his mother. Despite their separation, they remained legally married.

The Turning Point

In 2020, my father passed away suddenly in an accident—just two months after his mother (my mom’s MIL) passed away. Upon hearing the news, my mom’s first reaction was to gesture at her late MIL and say, ""You won. You succeeded and took him away from me."" That moment solidified the deep resentment and pain she had carried for decades.

After his passing, she discovered that my father had not entrusted many of his assets to her. He didn’t write a will, and she wasn’t named as a beneficiary for some of his financial matters. This was partly because, in the 1990s, my mom had struggled with impulsive spending and debt.

Her Mental and Physical Decline

While my dad’s passing worsened her state, her withdrawal actually began around 2015. Over the years, she has become increasingly isolated. She eats all her meals in her room, sometimes not leaving for weeks unless there is a family gathering.

When my baby was born, she struggled to cope and would slam her door shut. She refuses to spend time with my baby or my brother’s kids unless they go into her room. She curses at the hired caregivers regularly and has even hit herself if food offered to her isn’t cooked to her standards.

She also suffers from chronic knee pain, which makes her reluctant to go anywhere. But even when she takes pain medication, she remains emotionally unstable and unpredictable.

Her Resistance to Help

She sees a cardiologist for hypertension (she has had heart failure twice, in 2003 and again a few years later) and an oncologist for her breast cancer, but she has never seen a mental health professional. She refuses to acknowledge that she needs help.

She was on Restyl for years but stopped after 2020. She also became dependent on Tramadol after knee surgery, and I have helped her obtain it before just to keep her calm—but I know this isn’t right.

The Challenge with My Brother

One of the biggest challenges is that my mom behaves very differently in front of my brother—she fears him a little, so she is well-behaved when he's around. For a long time, he didn’t fully believe there was a serious problem because he never saw her at her worst. It felt like only my husband and I were witnessing her deterioration. But after I finally shared everything with him, he now understands how severe the situation is.

What I Need Help With

I want her to see a psychiatrist to assess her mental health and possibly provide medication to help stabilize her. But I have no idea how to convince her without her taking it as personal criticism. She is extremely sensitive and always feels attacked.

How do I approach this? How do I get her the help she needs when she refuses to see that she has a problem? Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated",How to get my mom serk support,1741618292.0,1j80eta

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello friends, so I’m a (23M) and I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for the past 8-10 years. I’ve had active suicidal thoughts at times the past 5 years. 

The closest I ever came to following through with these thoughts by overdosing was in my 3rd year of university about 3-4 years ago. I remember being my bedroom of the rented room I got for school and I was sitting in my chair having a mental breakdown from being overwhelmed by a new environment (This was my 3rd year at school, but my 2nd year was all online because of Covid 19, so I was at home). I remember my anxiety was so bad that I wouldn’t want to go upstairs to make food in our houses shared kitchen since I was socially anxious about interacting with the 3 other guys that lived upstairs. So I was almost starving myself at times (They were all great guys btw, my anxiety was just really really bad), was also really worried about finding my classes and not being late (Like every other student), also had multiple assignments that I just felt super overwhelmed with, wasn’t getting hardly any sleep either. I remember being up until 3-4am most nights just sitting in bed staring into nothing and having rapid thoughts going through my mind about all kinds of things. Majority of them about how I am a failure, I won’t be able to do the normal tasks that people can do, you know those negative kind of thoughts.

So I remember that day I cameback from class after worrying all night about missing the bus and not finding my classes. I just sat down in my chair and just broke down. I just couldn’t control it at all, felt my body just getting very achy, started to get a pounding headache, was almost hyperventilating it seemed and I went into my closet and grabbed a bottle of Advil. I just waved it around for a bit and just thought how easy it would be to just not have to deal with any of it. I remember I opened the bottle and grabbed a pill out and just was almost idolized it. I just didn’t want to deal with any of
It anymore and in that moment I remember the usual thoughts of “Don’t do it, you will hurt the people around you, they will suffer long after you’re gone” and “You can’t do that to your family & friends”. Which were the usual thoughts I would have when my suicidal thoughts got really bad, since I don’t want to hurt the people around me and I truly believe that’s always been the reason I never went through with any of my suicidal intentions. Because if I didn’t have great people in my life that cared about me, I would have been gone years ago. Like I have heard stories about people not going through with it, because they are afraid of death & what comes after. But for me I was not afraid of that, I just wanted to be free. So while all that is going on, that sameday I just happened to have a scheduled appointment call with my schools therapist and I also think that call saved my life since it was just nice in that moment to have someone to talk with and I remember telling her I was holding that bottle of Advil and all thoughts I was having. She was amazing, she listened to everything I was trying to say at the time and just convinced me all these feelings will pass (And they did). 

So that was my closest suicidal moment, since then I’ve had similar moments at times in my life (But not to that point again) and I’m in a similar suicidal thoughts period right now it seems. Over the past week I’ve had 2 breakdowns, 1 passed pretty quickly and wasn’t too bad to deal with. The other I remember being in the bathroom getting ready for a shower and it just hit me, all the thoughts of not being able to find a job in Canada in the field I studied for or get any kind of job for that matter, was going to get a haircut that day with a friend as well and I was anxious about that, not being able to find my partner in crime throughout all my 23 years on this planet, thoughts of going back to school for another program, thoughts of my parents thinking I’m a failure and me thinking I am letting them down by not moving forward with my life. While the people I grew up with have been moving forward. I just remember having those same physical symptoms that I had before when I was the closest to taking my life and this episode lasted about 15-25min. I remember trying to ground myself by sitting on the floor or trying any of the techniques I’ve learned over the years and nothing worked. But I just let time do its thing and I was okay after those 15-25min once I got it all out of my system. 

My parents have started to notice since I’m just acting different I guess (Not in a bad way to them) but I’m just being more to myself and lying in bed more often.

All this to say, I told my mom I would tell her what’s going on when she gets back from her trip, since she came into my room before she left saying I could tell her anything and she wouldn’t be upset with me. I just have no idea how to go about telling my parents something this big without scaring them and I don’t want to do that. Since everyone in my life has always seen me as a happy & always smiling individual. Like I know suicidal thoughts is a very big deal, but again like I’m sure a lot of others are that deal with this stuff. You don’t want to become a burden to those you share these mental health struggles with.

Would love to know others experiences with telling their parents or loved ones about these heavy topics and how they went about it.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello guys I suffer horribly from a weird problem for years when you hear it it sounds stupid but it's extremely bad and hurtful to me. Basically where I grown up nintendo isn't popular I got a wii in 2010 and ever since then if I see or hear someone from my community watch play or even mention a name related to nintendo I feel something extremely bad and hurtful I tried to study why for years I read tons of resources talked to therapists I even learned hypnosis lucid dreaming cbt and other things to try to understand why and stop it. What is weird to me is that I never found any other human who have a similar problem when he feel like me when someone consume something he likes. I didn't know what to called it I discovered the word gate keeping and it sounds like the closest thing to what am dealing with.

I remember having similar problem since I was a kid for eample I remember hiding my games if my cousins are coming because am afraid they will like it and buy one and I still feel the same thing about other things like shows anime or sometimes even people but all of those are really really mild and not more than an annoyies for a second then I move on.

I don't know what to do. I (F 17 ) have been struggling with anxiety for a while like around 2 Years i have been
 terrefield of speaking in class. I'm in 12th Grade and i 'm supposed to be graduating in a year. But since 2 Weeks i have become terrified of going to school. I thought it was bad before but now it's so much worse. It started when i got really anxious in englisch class. I had to ask the girl sitting next to me, to leave class with me. Wenn i left i was fine but when we came back inside i realised i couldnt do It. So i left. Every day after that when i came to class i was so scared and i could hardly stay in that class. I had stomach aches (which i also have writing this) sweaty hands and just plain panic i felt claustrophobic and wanted to leave immediatly. When i leave i'm always immediatly fine but i just can't keep on enduring this.
I only had 2 days of school this week because of holidays.
On thursday i had history class. I had to leave once to ""go to the toilet"" the window has to be open at all times and i cried like twice because i was so scared and feeling terrible.
After that i left even though i still had 4 classes.
On Friday i had maths i started panicing even though one of my closest friends was sitting next to me. I started crying and told her how i felt.
She already kind of knew because the girl i was sitting next to in history told her she was worried abt. Me.
After that i had a free period and i was hanging out with my sister and i was feeling amazing. It was friday, i had endured math and i was only going to have chemistry with the close friend of mine who i already mentiond.
In chemistry i was feeling horrible again. I coulndnt shake the thoughts and the anxiaty. I told my friend to open a window, it didnt work and to ask for a 5 minute break. After the break was over i wasnt able to get myself to go in again. So we stayed out the 45 minutes left i cried again of frustration andmy friend was quite worried abt me but we also laughed and joked.
My teacher was super nice abt it btw.
I really like school and i already found it frustrating when i couldnt say what i wanted to in class but i cant go on like this.
Tomorrow i have an important exam, the day after that too.
The next months i will be having 2 exams a week but i cant go.
I will have stomach aches and wont be able to concentrate on what i'm writing.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello, I am currently 21. Sorry I didn't put that in the title.

Throwaway account because I feel terrible about this.

I also posted this on r/TrueOffMyChest. Posting it here because I need some help (or at least words of advice) if anyone can offer.

When I was young (10 maybe) and I got an Ipod. I would love doing stuff on it. But then I got into fanfiction and thus I got into porn (I still love fanfiction to this day). I also was able to gain access to porn sites (Pornhub, Xvideoes, Spankbang, etc). My mom had to work long hours and my uncle mostly left me alone (we're both quiet), it got more convinent when I got old enough to become a lackey kid (14)

But that day, I was in the mood for porn every chapter (what I now know as PWP)

So I would type chapter 'large number' and then put tits or ass and then search. I was already seeing gross things I wasn't supposed to but then I found a website and it had adults engaging with minors.

I was aware that sort of thing was bad, but this was written not visual. I knew the visual stuff was terrible and never looked for that sort of thing. But the written stuff?

I just kept reading it, I justified it as it's only weird if I'm an adult. I never visualized ACTUAL real life children, I would think about other fictional characters, not sure if that's better but I did.

But now I'm an adult and I feel disgusting! I NEVER want to hurt a child in that way! I despise child molestors! And yet I still read this stuff. I stopped when I was about 18-19 (not sure spefically but I know I haven't read that stuff in the past three years and I remember not being able to find the sites anymore, which was good in the long run)

Lately, I've been feeling really gross. Like I'm disgusting and I should feel awful what I did! Which I should! It's gotten worse this past year, I didn't really think about it. I still read stuff where characters were underage but limited to just being in their teens (someone on AO3 who does a bunch of Harry Potter/crossover girls stuff and another one who had his own website and was registered on Literotica). I want to cut those people out of my reading too! I feel horrible for what I've done and read.

More context: I live with my mother (she knows about the video porn thing, but not the written stuff), I'm a college student, I can't drive (I rideshare everywhere). I WANT to get therapy but I don't want to spend money. My mom has actually taken me to therapy a few times (this problem hadn't affected me mentally yet for me to bring it up, plus most of the time my mother was in room, so I wouldn't have done so regardless), I actually got diagnosed with anxiety. But I assume the reason we don't make it a regular thing is because it's expensive. The best thing I feel I can do is go to hotlines.

Sometimes they do make me feel better. Once I watched some YT video about someone who hurt animals and I thought I could handle it, but the woman said this man also read stuff from one of the sites I found (I never liked that, I would avoid that if I saw it) and I FELT DESPECIBLE! The hotline got me a nice lady that told me some gentle things that made me calm down.

But then I read one of the guy's I mentioned work on Literotica, the characters were ACTUALLY OF LEGAL AGE and it felt like I relapsed! Then I watched porn on a specific website for specific kink of me, but when I was looking for something one of the videoes said 'teenage' and I began to spiral. Because of one hand, not all pornsites are trustworthy but on the other, 18 and 19 (legal adult age) could still be referred to as teenage so I was confused, so I called them and the lady didn't want to help me and she transferred me to a warmline (they were nice but they asked for my insurance which I wasn't expecting so I ended up feeling emotionally drained).

It came to a head when I woke up this morning and I was on my period and then I started feeling those thoughts that was disgusting while my body was in pain. I couldn't call because my mother was still asleep. So I texted my hotline and the woman said my problem wasn't something a hotline could fix, so she sent me all these links to porn addiction stuff. They either cost money or I felt they couldn't help me, because they talked about this happening to men. Alternatively, they could help but my mother was still in the house, so I still felt I couldn't do anything immediately. And it really felt like no one could help me. I even signed up for Betterhelp (though I remembered they had controversy and signed out before telling my problem). So I decided to post this on here.

I really don't want to hurt anyone. I want to put that terrible part of my past behind me. But sometimes I can't help but think about it and feel disgusting.",I feel disgusting because of something I did as a minor.,1741534241.0,1j7a15c

 I am at the end of my matriculate year or a some countries called um there last year of High School so um it's become kind of stressful for me a lot like extremely to give you some context I am a person who takes my study seriously I plan weeks ahead I take ample risk trying to maintain my health I've been doing this for years without trouble but at this point it's become too much no uh I've already written couple of tests um exams and my English is well my Mathematics was wrong my secondary language was well and uh yeah I still have opposite right now um I wrote my business studies and uh well that did not go out I was not expecting a lot to go by I study hard really hard I put a lot of efforts into it I walked into exam room wrote that test with Confidence and I walked out with Confidence and the well looks like that confidence was for not I really got up bad grade bad terrible I had never gone a treat that bad in my entire life and normally I wouldn't be too worried if it wasn't my last year of high school if it wasn't the year then determines whether I make it or break it now normally I picked myself up I'd have to try again attitude but um um didn't go on most of you probably thinking why the hell would I come to right about this on reddit of all places but um that's because I have no one to go to no one my own parents have this they're not trying hard enough mindset your help went on thinking that I'm I'm just let's studying enough I'm faking studying my friends think I'm an idiot saying um I'm also not studying enough my teachers tell me I'm not studying enough I have no one to go to no one to run to no one to cry too no one at all and um that's just the reality well um honestly don't know what to do with this point I feel like I'm just not meant for School I try my absolute heartist nothing has been paying off the last time I had proper eight hours of sleep was legitimately during January January was the last month where on a date I've had full it hours of sleep and like I said I'm someone who takes these seriously including my health and this is the first time I've ever ended up in a state like this like it's so bad I'm constantly getting migrants and bad pain from the stress alone that's hope bad it is someone who's 18 19 getting back pains and I'm someone who's very physically healthy but at this point it I'm deteriorating it's gotten to a point where I  can't sleep properly I can't think properly I can't do anything properly I have no motivation I have no support and it's basically getting to me. Now most of the Year probably thinking your Minds he kid why not go to what therapist oh it's kind of high to do that when your own parents believe you're just not doing anything hard enough then your own teachers don't think you're doing anything hard enough and it's not like I can just call the cops and see hey my parents don't believe I'm going insane. I basically surrounded by a society people that have the notion that um if you're complaining about not being able to do anything it's just you being weak it's just you not doing anything hard enough and well yeah that's reality unfortunately so um not knowing what to do I came here and I thought ranting about it online change 

but thank you anyway for listening it's appreciated♥️

MentalHealthSupport,"I am a male 16 year old junior in high school. I participate in dance, musical theatre, and choir. My grades are good, I have friends, a single mom and a decent support system. I haven’t touched drugs, alcohol or anything like that. And if I continue living, I don’t plan to.

I often go through periods of depression and fear of the future, I feel like where I want to go, I’ll never be able to reach. I don’t like talking to my mom about these things, she ways tries to fix them but doesn’t see it the same way I do and I feel it would be better that she just stayed out of it. School regularly feels overwhelming and sometimes I just don’t want to do anything anymore. This weekend (March 7th, 2025) I was very close to taking my life. I even started looking up painless ways to do it haha. Things just seem like they would be easier if there was nothing to deal with. I don’t want to die, I see lots of beauty in the future and in life, but the trials and tribulations so far have made it extremely hard to keep going. I haven’t been diagnosed anything explicit, however I took some different online tests on my own accord today and I tested mostly positive for bipolar disorder. 

There will be days where I go to school and have a great day, surrounded by friends and laughter and joy, but the moment I get home and look over everything, it all seems different, and negative. I question everything that happened, and all the reactions of my peers and friends. And other days I will wake up feeling terrible, and the entire day will be terrible. I often have arguments with my mom and teachers. I identify as homosexual, but often I’ll find weird interests in women, strictly sexual. 

I don’t really know my purpose. And I am almost out of time to figure it out. 1 year, and then I go to college or wherever from there. I am in the low income and it is just my mother and I in the house. I should start working on scholarships and things like that but I just don’t have any motivation to do it. 

I feel like it’s impossible to live in the world without having to do something you don’t want to, constantly. I wish there was a way to just, live. No boundaries or rules telling you to do this or that. I confessed to my mom a week ago I was contemplating suicide, and she flipped out. Took my phone, laptop etc. She’s been watching me pretty close recently, although I’ve explained to her I don’t want to, and I won’t. I’m not really sure where to go from here. What would really happen to the world if I just went away?

So i've started, on stairs i often walk on, having a serten step i KNOW the number of. In my school i know there is a pole inbetween every forth step, at home the stairs are curved so the only even step is in the middle of the stair. 

Though i forgot all stairs are an uneven number. That means the step, that i've desited is a certain number, changes depending on wich way you go. It's no annoying because now i can only focus on that one step and it brings me so much anxity that i don't even want to go up and down the stairs because it takes so much mental energy just to get myself to get up and down.

MentalHealthSupport,"I have known this friend of mine for a year, we have met through a common friend. Lets call her Jen. First time meeting Jen , she’s full of energy, talking about her life etc etc though I cant give a little talk about my self, it was okay for me, I didnt think that it was odd or weird. 
So, one time we were hanging out together with her friends, Jen started this conversation about boys she liked, it was an engaging conversation tbh, then her friend wanted to give a little story, but every time her friend tries to tell the story, Jen would always interrupt her and tells her story & speech instead. After a couple of nights hanging out with Jen and her friends, there are times that when I tell a story to her friends, she becomes quiet, visibly upset, leaves the room and comes back again then changes the topic, there are also times that whenever I say my experiences in life, I felt that she doesnt really care and heads to change the topic. I kinda feel that she wanted all the attention only for her, she would often ask for validation if she’s pretty or not despite knowing that she’s actually pretty. 
I dont think it is a basis to know if someone has depression or not, there are several cases where shes having a bad day at work, nothings going her way or what she had planned, even with such small things, she would break down crying & screaming. 
I am really frustrated with her, I dont know how to address to her about how I feel in fear of making her upset knowing she’s sensitive and how she makes me feel because of her superiority complex most of the time. I dont want her to be upset causing more harm to her mental state but it is also damaging my mental health as well, I have been suppressing my emotions and keep trying to understand her because she has depression but while I protect her feelings and emotions, I start to feel drained myself, I even felt that im starting to have anxiety.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi, I've been trying to figure out whats up with me recently by having a really good think, and looking deep into my feelings. 
One thing I've always felt was that somebody was supposed to tell me something that would make everything make sense and for some reason I missed that day of school or something. 
Everyone seems to know what they're doing, or have some understanding of the world that I don't have. I think I was about 7yo when I first had this feeling and I'd say once a month I feel it again.
When I was young it originated mostly from people having social skills I never had, and understanding of what's happening. As I've gotten older this has transferred into life skills such as organisation.

MentalHealthSupport,"I guess my primary issues right now are loneliness and hopelessness. I know I really need to see a real therapist but a therapist can’t be my friend and I think that is probably what I need. 
In the past I had pretty intense depression and anxiety driven more by internal factors and presently it is more environmental factors that I can only control to a certain extent which makes my mental health even worse bringing out the control freak in me.
I am desperately looking for a full time job in an area where I know no one but my boyfriend. I would be trying to meet people through shared interests but I have no money to even afford those things. I’m pretty sure I’m autistic as well though I was never formally diagnosed. I just find it incredibly difficult to relate to people and typically lack the energy to interact which obviously makes me more lonely. Guess I am just looking for support/ someone to talk to.

MentalHealthSupport,"I posted this rant on the ADHD sub about six months ago but I only just found this community so will post it verbatim here.

ADHD would explain why so much of my adult life has been so empty, lonely and miserable. I simply don't have the mental energy to put the effort into improving my life. Making friends, reaching out to people, being open and honest, enquiring and getting to know people, finding love, it's all been SO IMPOSSIBLY TIRING.

In December, I was referred to Nightingale Hospital in London to treat a possible deficiency of some kind. We hadn't said 'ADHD' yet so we were still treating depression symptoms. I was put on 20mg of Bupropion and it was like a third eye had been opened. I felt more present and active than I ever had in my entire life. My internal protective filter was gone and I was the happiest and most present I'd ever felt. I went to a friends 30th and danced the most freely I'd ever done before.

Then my dosing got interrupted by forgetting to get the re-up when I'd run out. I'd gone a whole weekend without any. I got more from my local pharmacy but none of it, even under a double dose, ever did anything again.

After talking through the possibility of ADHD with my therapist, I went back to Nightingale and the questionnaire also pointed to the possibility of ADHD. After a couple of other meds including Modafinil and Concerta did nothing for me I'm now on 50mg of Elvanse after feeling groggy and headachy after a few days of 60..

And... it's working but it's not the same. I'm not overeating all the time like I usually do, I'm finding household and other mundane tasks easier to start ant follow through, but I don't have that clarity that I desperately want again, and it's fucking up my sleep which just has a knock on effect on the rest of my day. Maybe I need to try Bupropion again but the Doctor just said he 'didn't know' why it would stop working on me. I often feel like I'm somehow fairly resistant to medication working on me.

I don't know - I'm sitting here at night having not spoken to a single human being all day. I'm getting sick of the loneliness, old friends just don't respond to my invitations or messages any more and it doesn't help with the feeling of brokenness I've carried with me my whole life. My therapist would probably encourage me to be more direct and open with those people and try to start that dialogue in a more sincere manner (and being more open and vulnerable sounds like the most impossible thing to me - when has it ever been taught to me that that's okay, and acceptable, and wanted from me in society, or with people?) and frankly I feel a bit betrayed by the callousness of it all.

I once asked some Reddit forums for advice on how to deal with the pain of having so little fanfare or celebration on my last birthday and I was basically called pathetic for daring to care about it treated like a pathetic loser for caring at my age. Am I meant to just pack it in? To eat shit? To stop dreaming of a fulfilling life of friendship? The kind I've never had?

Sorry - to get back on track.... I feel like I'm so close, to finding the medication that will make it click and bring back that clarity, that feeling like I don't need to filter myself any more. But deep inside I'm scared that..... there isn't an answer. That I will keep trying and trying to find the pills that unlock my potential and one day run out of options and find out that the voice in my head that tells me that there is no place in society for me is true.","I am so close, yet so far - I need focus in life and I can't make it happen",1741558756.0,1j7jcbo
MentalHealthSupport,"Today I let a friend sleepover. I let her sleep over often because she has problems at home and she doesn't like staying at her dorms. I find it quite childish to not want to be somewhere just because she doesn't like it, her roommate's are really good and everything. So just a few minutes ago she was playing some games and usually I show her that I'm aware of her existence by just by touching her leg, I do it all the time and she never had any problems with it, but today she aggressively told me to fuck off and aggressively grabbed my hand leaving mild scratches, but it reminded me so much of my mom.

For more backstory my mom is an abusive alcoholic that likes her dogs more than her children. She used to be really aggressive and violent towards me, and one of the first times that I remember her being violent was when she grabbed my arms so hard that my arm blad and it left little scars to this day.

* “These people are so stupid.”
* “Why do they like to mess things up?”
* “Fucking idiots.”

And it's no longer from stress pulling but a habit even when bored. I am not officially diagnosed with this except for ADHD but I am highly sure I do. I put on makeup to cover my brows that r slowly growing back and lashes too and it's so annoying . I can't stop pulling it. Idk why I do it and I look crazy and I feel so bad about myself. I had also binge eat a lot from stress or borednwss. I take strattera for ADHD but idk if any med will help with this bad habit. Idk how to stop it. I do believe this habit came from when I was 11-12 when I had my first cocketail bird. She died prob from stress but this will get sad and very graphic as I want to be as honest as I can be. I remember plucking her feathers and picking her skin, feet nose etc and it'll bleed or scab a lot . Idk why I did at the time bc I was so young but I also felt so regretful and my parents didn't understand why and were of course mad at me. Right now I have a different parrot and I love her very much and I rarely ever pluck her feathers nor skin and she's 7 year old now, living longer than my first which is great.

What can I do to prevent it and I want to understand why this could be the case?  Would meds help or just distraction?

Unfortunately, his parents don’t live in the city where my family lives but his city is like very close to mine (1 hour long). We met one time in a week or sometimes in two weeks. So from September we started to have misunderstandings. I think I was often overreacting and being too jealous, maybe acting childish. He had problems at home and i had my personal issues as well. For some reason i felt like he was distancing himself from me, sometimes i felt like a burden. I still don’t know if it was real or i just made it up. 

However, on 5 November 2024, we had a fight bc he got sick a couple of days before and we had to cancel our plans but on that day he went to help his friend with the house construction but i got to know this only in the evening because he disappeared for the whole day and didn’t say a word to me. I was fine with him helping his friend, i was just very worried about him since he was sick and hearing nothing from him for the whole day had always been awful for me. After I told him that him not texting me during the day hurts me, he wrote a huge paragraph to me and proposed to end our relationship bc he is “not suitable for me”. I was shocked… he wrote many other things that were saying that I hadn’t done anything for him and our relationship, that I am not grateful and so forth. I couldn’t believe and next morning I took a bus and went straight to him. He seemed like he didn’t want to see me and he was insisting on ending our relationship. He told me that he didn’t feel joy because he only thought of my joy all the time. He also said things like “i am so glad when i wish you good night because it means that I won’t have to text you until tomorrow”, “I don’t know if i really love you or you made me think that i love you”. Those phrases are still running through my head. I knew I wasn’t right in certain aspects, for example, I constantly brought up things from the past which I am not proud of. I apologised and asked for a second chance and we stayed together.

Since that one situation I fixed my behaviour and stuff that made him uncomfortable so i stopped asking him to inform me of his actions, plans in advance. Interestingly enough, he refused to talk about his wish to break up and about that day in general. I once asked him what he meant by saying that he doesn’t know if he really loves me, and he got mad. Also, in November, we met only once and that was our last meeting. He hadn’t initiated even one call himself for that month. When I wanted to call him, he agreed to talk only twice. But he did talk about our future. Also, when I asked him if everything was ok or the same between us, he reassured me that all is fine and i am exaggerating. 

Dec 11: i felt that he was in a bad mood so i asked why. He said that he feels a bit cold and is tired of everything. However, in the morning he said that he is cold to me and he doesn’t know when it started… he then said that he wants to leave as he feels nothing towards everything and including me and that he wants to be alone. He said that he didn’t feel happy anymore because all he did was thinking of my happiness and now he wants to think of himself. For certain reasons, i believed that all of that was temporary and he might be depressed. Our conversation lasted for a couple of days. I was insisting on making a pause at least but on staying together. On Dec 16 I told him that he can always reach me and he can take his time and i will wait for him. He blocked me on every social media that day. Later i texted his friend to know if he’s doing good bc as i said i was sure that he had a depressive episode. His friend promised to talk to him but after they talked his friend blocked me too. 

I decided to give him some time hoping that after some cooling off he would unblock me but i am still blocked. So i decided to create a new instagram account (he blocked the previous one) and text him just to know how he’s doing. I also hoped that this might help me to let him go. However, a few days before his birthday he opened his previously private instagram account. I saw that he started to mutually follow the girls from his old workplace that made me uncomfortable and that he had always said he had zero interest in and there was also one new girl that i don’t know. After I saw his following list, i had a real panic attack. Moreover, he posted photos 5 days after he broke with me and there were pics that we took together and that he sent to me. I think after that I started to think (maybe realise) that it’s not like he wants to be alone, he just doesn’t want to be with me anymore. In the end, I couldn’t text him. It hurt me. 
 
I am so shocked and i still can’t believe that we are not together anymore. We’ve been through a lot, I, him and everyone were sure that we were going to get married. I can’t live normally all these months. I feel guilty for not being supportive and appreciative enough, for bringing up the past and for overreacting. I often feel like i have given up on him too easily. Today i even had a thought that i should have been tried more, should’ve been called him from a different number on the new year. I still love him. I have a constant urge to talk to him, to text him. I don’t know how to live and what to do next. I just don’t know

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi,

I got a SAD light in 2022 and it has worked wonders but recently, I have noticed an issue with my moods and the light.

If it’s ever on for too long, I get incredibly angry or sad, it doesn’t matter if I was happy prior to the light being on, I still end up feeling the same way.

But I’m also unsure if this issue is due to the fact that I hate night time in general, I hate that my day has come to an end and that I can’t continue with all the nice things I did that day.

What made it even harder was coming home and being met with yelling and awful things being said to me. It felt like I was a kid again, coming home from school and getting yelled at. I was already carrying so much, and instead of support, it felt like I was just being attacked.

It might sound silly, but it felt like everyone else got the care and support for their service, but not me. Like I didn’t matter the same way.

I’ve always felt like others got that kind of support from their parents—getting called sweet things like “my marine” and having that care. It’s hard not to notice the difference, especially since I’m a girl. ",Not home?,1741459824.0,1j6nza5

I’ve realized I have mommy issues and that I’m submissive—gentle submissive, to be exact.

MentalHealthSupport,"I’m 21 (m) I started drinking at 16. I only drink Because everyone around did, even those I looked up to. I had no idea why people drink alcohol. I just thought it was something adults do for fun. I stopped drinking alcohol from age 18 to 21 . Now I’m gonna be 22 life just made a huge turn for me I believe I’m going through phase in my life where I’m just uncertain about everything from making decisions that can be life changing to choosing the right path. Don’t get me wrong I’m doing really well for a 21 year old. I don’t go to parties I don’t have too many friends I work a lot I make about 65-75k/yr. I don’t do drugs I don’t smoke weed ( occasionally but smoking isn’t really my thing maybe once every couple a months) and for some reason I’m always anxious. Always over thinking. I’m losing sleep over my own thoughts. Creating scenarios in my head and putting myself in a bad head space. My anxiety has been so bad that I can’t get it up sometimes for sex. And I’m pretty healthy to be honest. I’m 5 11 I weigh 173lbs I don’t eat junk food I haven’t been exercising the way I’m suppose to but I’m in decent shape. So I know it’s a mental thing. (Luckily I have an understanding gf) I don’t have the best relationship with either of my parents. 

Earlier this month I decided to give liquor a try again.  
And let me tell you I started feeling a euphoric feeling after my first 2 glasses. My gf was surprised to see me in a good mood. Usually she talked me to sleep but this time I was the talker and she listened to me. I literally explain to this girl why I loved her so much (unfiltered conversation) I felt confident and not over thinking anything. We had great sex that night I didn’t have any trouble getting my Johnson up I felt good and I was just so relaxed about everything and just happy. My anxiety was absent I couldn’t hear shit my inner critic had to say to fuck up the moment. And honestly I can control my drinking I will never become an addict I know how to cope without it even if it’s very difficult to actually relax and be present. But I don’t think it will be wrong to take a couple glasses every now and then. And I know us men barely have a shoulder to cry on sometimes and we have no other option to turn to the liquor and drink our problems away. ALCOHOL IS NOT THE SOLUTION GUYS!!! DRINK IN MODERATION. Alcohol can actually help you analyze your problems and get to the root of what causes you to feel certain ways. Pay attention to it and don’t get hooked.

MentalHealthSupport,"I am 38 y/o female, have always been single, have no close friends anymore who aren’t wrapped up in kids and their families, no siblings, my parents are around but are abusive and I feel like a constantly forgotten about human. 

I continually try to work on myself because I don’t blame other people - the common denominator is me - but even with all the work to try to be better and more receptive and open, I’m still just a passing thought it seems.  I think this makes it the hardest - that I’m just not good enough no matter what. 

I have social anxiety and online dating is horrible to me. I’ve tried the apps hundreds of times but I can’t bear it. 

Though no thoughts of harming myself in any way, I just have no desire for life.  No more hope of a family, tired of trying to make friends only for them to find someone and get married and forget about me, exhausted from professional networking that feels fake and superficial, drained from connectionless interactions. 

I recently was laid off from my job a few weeks ago and was shocked and hurt how few people reached out.   I was there for 4 years and was very involved. 

I’m kind and generous - constantly supporting others in so many ways, including financially when they need help.  

Typing this out I think — well this just sounds like you’re an unlikable, uninteresting, forgettable person.  I know it does, trust me! I just can’t figure out why to fix it. I try. 

I feel as if I’ve been a bit of a tortured soul my whole life. Like I’m being isolated from the world and just in it as an observer rather than a participant. 

Ive talked to a therapist but even with therapy, I don’t feel connected or truly heard. It feels like they’re always giving me suggestions of things I’ve tried a bajillion times with no luck like “joining a group that does something you like” or “just try one date online”. Been there done that more times than I can count. 

Anyone else feel this way?  I see people posting but then say “my husband” or “my sister” but I truly have nothing but my dog, who is my world.  Is this depth of loneliness common or am I also alone on this?

My heart aches thinking about my situation.
I have never told this to anyone.

After years of having these feelings, I am writing this post to seek advice. 

I really need help. I feel like I am dying inside.

I am 26, male.
In childhood and teen days I have faced a lot of hate, abandonment from my parents.

Age: 9 to 15
I(assume I am Ram) was not a bright student, I used to get average grades in school. Due to this I faced a lot of shouting and somtimes beating from my parents.

My brother(lets call him Shyam) on the other hand used to score way above average scores. Due to this he got a lot of love. He got a lot of recognition in family both on nani and dadi side. 
People used to say Shyam kitna acha hai padhne me, Ram toh bekar nikammma ladka hai.
My brother was also usually very sick, maybe because of that he got more love and sympathy from my parents.

Whenever me and my brother had a dispute my parents always took my brother's side.

They used to shout at me and I used to get angry and irritated. 

Age: 15 to 21
My mother even told my brother not to talk to me. Even my mother stopped talking to me multiple times. How can a mother do this? 

These situation was not just once and twice, this used to happen frequently. 

Even my father used to shout at me on lots of things. When we have an argument then he also just stopped talking to me multiple times. 

Once my father stopped talking to me for 11 days. Can you imagine, you and your father are living in a same house, sitting in same rooms, seeing each other daily but your father is not talking to you?

And these situations used to repeat frequently. My respect for both my parents went down a lot. I even left my home once after argument with my parents.

These situations led me to do bad things like weed, cigarette, etc.

I kept smoking cigarette for years but now I have quit.

Around age 21-22:
In lockdown, due to bad economic condition at my home I decided that I will start studying and get a good job.

After some time of my graduation I got a really good job and starting earning very well.

After the job, I didn't face much shouting or arguments from my parents.

It just slowed down and my parents started respecting me. 

Around age 25:
Now I face very minimal argument or shouting from my parents side.

But we still have arguments. When we have arguments, my mind just goes back to the previous memories of my parents shouting at me, not talking to me for days, telling my brothers not to talk to me and so on.

Even small arguments or shouting triggers these feelings and brings back memories.

These are my parents who treated me like this, the two people who should always be on your side treated me like this? why did they shout at me? Why did they stopped talking to me? Why did they leave me lonely?
And now maybe I am earning, their attitude have changed towards me? Why?

Why did my parents did not sit down with me and talked to me when we had an argument? Why did my parents tried to solve things rather than not talking me to?

These memories are very hurting, I just keep thinking about these feelings. I feel so empty inside. I have started to not like my father, even though I love him. I automatically don't like talking to him.

Maybe I was at fault for not scoring good marks and arguing with my parents, that is why they treated me like this?

I don't know.

MentalHealthSupport,"I posted this rant on the ADHD sub about six months ago but I only just found this community so will post it verbatim here.

ADHD would explain why so much of my adult life has been so empty, lonely and miserable. I simply don't have the mental energy to put the effort into improving my life. Making friends, reaching out to people, being open and honest, enquiring and getting to know people, finding love, it's all been SO IMPOSSIBLY TIRING.

In December, I was referred to Nightingale Hospital in London to treat a possible deficiency of some kind. We hadn't said 'ADHD' yet so we were still treating depression symptoms. I was put on 20mg of Bupropion and it was like a third eye had been opened. I felt more present and active than I ever had in my entire life. My internal  protective filter was gone and I was the happiest and most present I'd ever felt. I went to a friends 30th and danced the most freely I'd ever done before.

Then my dosing got interrupted by forgetting to get the re-up when I'd run out. I'd gone a whole weekend without any. I got more from my local pharmacy but none of it, even under a double dose, ever did anything again.

After talking through the possibility of ADHD with my therapist, I went back to Nightingale and the questionnaire also pointed to the possibility of ADHD. After a couple of other meds including Modafinil and Concerta did nothing for me I'm now on 50mg of Elvanse after feeling groggy and headachy after a few days of 60..

And... it's working but it's not the same. I'm not overeating all the time like I usually do, I'm finding household and other mundane tasks easier to start ant follow through, but I don't have that clarity that I desperately want again, and it's fucking up my sleep which just has a knock on effect on the rest of my day. Maybe I need to try Bupropion again but the Doctor just said he 'didn't know' why it would stop working on me. I often feel like I'm somehow fairly resistant to medication working on me.

I don't know - I'm sitting here at night having not spoken to a single human being all day. I'm getting sick of the loneliness, old friends just don't respond to my invitations or messages any more and it doesn't help with the feeling of brokenness I've carried with me my whole life. My therapist would probably encourage me to be more direct and open with those people and try to start that dialogue in a more sincere manner (and being more open and vulnerable sounds like the most impossible thing to me - when has it ever been taught to me that that's okay, and acceptable, and wanted from me in society, or with people?) and frankly I feel a bit betrayed by the callousness of it all.

I once asked some Reddit forums for advice on how to deal with the pain of having so little fanfare or celebration on my last birthday and I was basically called pathetic for daring to care about it treated like a pathetic loser for caring at my age. Am I meant to just pack it in? To eat shit? To stop dreaming of a fulfilling life of friendship? The kind I've never had?

Sorry - to get back on track.... I feel like I'm so close, to finding the medication that will make it click and bring back that clarity, that feeling like I don't need to filter myself any more. But deep inside I'm scared that..... there isn't an answer. That I will keep trying and trying to find the pills that unlock my potential and one day run out of options and find out that the voice in my head that tells me that there is no place in society for me is true.","I am so close, yet so far",1741386063.0,1j620ke

I don't think I'm cut out for life. I don't feel like I'm fit in or in place. I am emotionally sensitive and empathetic. I don't feel like I belong. I can't find a job that pays a liveable wage. I have had a good amount of jobs for my age.  Don't have a driver license yet and I can't afford lessons right now but whats the point if I can't afford a car. Even if I work full time and make 600 a week I still wouldn't be able to afford one.

 I am in community college for accounting. I worked 30 hours a week at a pharmacy and made 400 a week still not enough. I can't afford anything and it sucks to know that this is how life is and I would have to work 3 jobs. I reduced my hours to focus on studying but now I can't afford hobbies or all of my needs and definitely not any wants. 

Right now I'm still studying but don't know how I will keep paying for college since my father is a tax evader for fafsa. I could do a payment plan but It will be all of my money. I binge eat. I don't have anyone to talk to. I have mental illnesses including depression and when I was on antidepressants I gained lots of weight and binge eating got worse so I stopped. I see a therapist and it doesn't help all they do is just suggest meds. 

My dad is dying and I never grieved my brother committing suicide. I'm lonely but a man could quickly make my life worse and more complicated. All the jobs I've been applying to virtually pay the same $12-18. I'm back to self harming. I feel like a failure and feel guilty for being alive. My parents are abusive but I don't want to have a victim complex. I still live with them and I am not able to afford to move out even with roommates. Maybe my expectations for earning is too high and my standards for life as well.

I went to beauty school to become a certified nail technician just to find that there's virtually no job openings out there for that near me at the moment. Or they are part time working 1-2 days a week. I'm considering selling press ons though but its a saturated market and I don't know who would buy from me. I have had 2 businesses ages 16-20 that flopped. Multiple hobbies that flopped and there is absolutely nothing that I am passionate about or enjoy. I don't enjoy entertainment either.

I'm not sure what to do with my life and how to feel better and I have been forcing myself for the past few weeks to forget every single thing and move forward but I genuinely do not see much to be happy about.

When I confided in my friend she said I'm privileged and my life is not that bad and they have it worse. I'm not doubting others have it worse at all. What prompted me to write this post is while searching for a new job because my current one I am very underpaid and staff is toxic and I am sick of abuse from the customers, I realized I still can barely find anything that would allow me to live that I got overwhelmed and cried and my mother said that I need to grow up and asked me how am I going to manage to survive which is true, and I don't think I will to be honest. She also said that me crying causes her stress and said that the stress I cause her and my dad is what turns them to drink. She says I make excuses which I think is true in some cases. I have been dissocoating for the past 6 years and every second every minute every week every month and every year passes by me in seconds. I will wake up one day and be 50 if i make it to then wondering where all the time has gone. 

I think the people in my life think I am weak which is true. I'm not even trying to seek pity or be self pity or a victim but I just don't see the point. I am not a victim it is all my fault and I believe any abuse that I have endured I must of have deserved it. I just get easily overwhelmed and I don't know why and I am immature. 

I don't know what to do with my life and I need someone to tell me.

MentalHealthSupport,"

I (21M) have not really been happy ever. I grew up getting belittled by everyone around me, abused by an older sibling, treated like I'm stupid by both my parents and my other siblings, and I don't really have anything going on.

I live with my dad and sister right now, and I don't think they'd be hurt too much. I think they'd get over it an move on well.

I wanted a doctorate, and to be successful in college or in writing, but I don't have any motivation to really do anything ever. I work a job I hate, and I don't think my coworkers would be too bothered either.

I'm not dating anyone, in fact I recently got broken up with (The girl realized she's gay, which I don't blame her for. She can't help that. I hope she gets a woman who cares about her the same way I did.)

I've got a friend group I play DND and video games with every so often, but I don't think they'd really be too bothered either.

My sister is better than me in every way. She's accomplished, and intelligent, has a partner, and is doing so well in highschool. She's making none of the mistakes I did, like she pursues extracurriculars, and socializes, and she's gonna go far. I don't think I will or can.

Meanwhile, I'm struggling hard in college. I'm doing the prerequisites for a bachelors in science, but I've hit a brick wall where the last few classes I need feel impossible, and I get paralyzed and feel completely lost when it comes to the work. I'll likely be dropped from or fail most of my classes this semester, and I don't even do full time at college or work.

I do have depression and an attention disorder. I've received medication and counseling for both, and it did not work. I think I'm resistant to the medication or something because it doesn't do anything.

I kinda want to just disappear, or pick a direction and walk in it without telling anyone.

The only emotions that I can really recall for the last several years are anger, sadness, hopelessness, or numbness.

I don't know why I shouldn't just kill myself if it's always like this. Anyone who I'm close to would get over it, my cat and dog would go to my sister. Anyone who would be sad would only be sad for a little bit, and then they'd move on with their lives and be fine, while I'd finally get to be free of this.

I've got a note drafted, and I'll print it off or write a new one because its pretty venomous, and I don't know if I'd want my last words to family and friends to be so harsh, but I don't know.

I'll elaborate on any situations I mentioned if asked, but I think that's the important stuff.

I get I’m young just reaching adult hood but it’s been hard growing up. I never really tried going up to my parent figures for support because living in a Hispanic household mental health is no such thing. I’ve seen and went through things children shouldn’t deal with and I feel like people can’t grasp that concept when I try to express how I feel internally. Nothing I’ve done in my life has made me exceptionally proud of myself and when I tried to step out of my boundaries I was always met with bullying from my own family. I’ve kept to myself for so long and idk who to talk to anymore. My friends hear me but they don’t listen.

MentalHealthSupport,"There isn't much context besides what happened. Around the time of middle school, a friend thought it was funny to wrap her hands around my neck and sometimes would also kind of squeeze, but not enough to hurt me or cut off my air. I told her to stop and she didn't until high school. While I was in high school I had a boyfriend who touched my neck and I'd always jerk away. Even if there was a wall behind me, I wouldn't care. I'd hit my head on the wall if I had to say he'd stop touching my neck. Also, the girl randomly jumped on me or touched me and now I freak out at random touches. I'm asking if anyone might know if this is something like PSTD, anxiety, or if I'm just overreacting since the girl never did cut off my air.

She did this multiple times for the 2 years I was in middle school. In high school, she acted nicer, and I knew she was better due to her asking to touch me and such. I still tried to stay away from her and attempted to move classes to avoid her or have my other friends talk to her. I got flashbacks throughout high school and still get them now. Some days, I avoid everything due to flashbacks in the morning or during the day. Other times, I don't get flashbacks unless the girl directly talks to me or touches me. I think my ex-boyfriend also made it worse since he did a similar thing yet never choked me.

I dont think i want to end it, im not totally sure, but not a thought in the last year has brought me more peace and happiness than doing so. Im not even scared to think it anymore. I just feel like why not?

703,000 people commit every year, and a fraction of the amount tell their story on why they were wrong. Ive talked to anyone i could for help but i feel i just dont work that way, therapy, councillors, etc.

I’ve done things i cant even admit on reddit, hurt many people, and have never felt an ounce of empathy for these things I’ve done.

I have the thought that, who the hell knows whats good for me? like truly? my peace of mind is like jenny from forest gump, “Please turn me into a bird so i can fly far far away”

Who is to tell me im wrong that if i make the decision i wont go soaring in the sunset of bliss, fly high in the clouds with my family, bask in the moonlight of the heavens. Nobody can convince me anymore that talking to people and therapy is better than taking the chance on what i believe in.

Im not saying I’m going to kill myself tonight however, for the first time I’m not scared of it and i feel like i can get away from the darkness and brutality I’ve brought on myself and others.

MentalHealthSupport,"Soo...the last few months have been hell. It started with a series of traumatic events/big changes throughout the year that piled up and eventually overwhelmed me after one particularly traumatizing event. I couldn't sleep, my anxiety spiraled out of control, and it all went downhill from there. I believe this was.. December when I finally broke. I'm not sure, as I can't remember almost anything from then. I saw my psychiatrist back in...january? Of this year (Remember this) and not even 2 sentences in she said I was bipolar. (And this) All I could do was sit there in shock and simply utter 'no i'm not', and after that I kinda checked out. I do remember her mentioning it's because I have 'episodes'.....yes, I do have 'episodes' but of anxiety. Something will happen, completely overwhelm me and fuck me up for six months then I have to build myself up back from ground zero. It's always been something different, with the running theme of anxiety and some form of dissociation. First it was weird headaches (whaddya know, anxiety!!) then it was dissociation x 20, and now it's...this? When those pass, i'm completely fine, except for certain moments of anxiety. I am always in a mild state of dissociation and always on guard, but i'm..comfortable..?..with it when i'm not all messed up. So this particular episode, the one i'm experiencing right now, consists of phases. First, nonstop rampant anxiety, I couldn't sleep, eat, function. I was going a million miles a second. The thought of anything relaxing, things I enjoyed made me anxious. And then that calmed down, I thought I was on the road of feeling better...WRONG!!! I got sick ontop of lady problems. I think I was depressed? Low energy, dull, hopeless, I can't find enjoyment in anything, but overwhelmingly anxious. I got better, Then the dissociation kicked in and ohhh boy we went for a spin. My sleep schedule has been horrible this entire time. I'm too scared to sleep most nights. I'm either up all night, crash around 9am and wake up around 12pm (day) or I fall asleep anytime after 12am and wake up anywhere between 9am-11am. I have not been sleeping good. Last Saturday was one of those up all night bits, I didn't fall asleep til 9am sunday woke up around 1pm? 2pm? And then immediate dissociation. Night doesn't feel like it's night. The concept of time barely exists. I feel like I have been run over and backed up on by a train for extra measure. It's like a really weird, extreme depersonalization. And then maybe brain fog ontop of it? My thoughts feel dull, muted, like I can't think, and that has me in a tizzy because i've never felt that before. It feels like my body and mind are separated. But then me and my mind are also seperated? I feel like I can't engage in anything or distract myself. And when the anxiety bubbles over it's extremely overwhelming..like nothing I have felt before. It feels like everything i'm experiencing will never go away. But it's also like... completely in the background. Like i'm not feeling it to its full extent. Hence where the dissociation comes into play? Idk... it's the most intense, non intense feeling ever. I can't see my psychiatrist until the 25th. I feel like i'll go crazy before then. Every day is hell, and I don't know what's wrong with me. Anyhow, remember when I mentioned my psychiatrist? Yes..she prescribed me abilify. Funny story, i'm terrified to take medication, and having to take medication was the trigger of my last dissociation/anxiety combo finishing move. Couldn't leave the house for months. I was also on abilify during that time, near when I started feeling better. She said I told her I felt better on it...but I just can't remember telling her that? That was months ago.

MentalHealthSupport,"My sister in law lost her dad a couple years ago, and there's nothing that has helped her over the years to help cope with the situation. She refuses to accept it, and basically pretends her dad is ""on vacation"" I can't even say ""Dad"" around her (when referring to my own father) without her suddenly becoming emotional. This whole ordeal is taking a toll on my sister as well since they are both married and live together.

She becomes the most emotional and angry when she drinks, and then basically verbally attacks our whole family because she felt we were not there for her when her father passed.

Just recently, she spoke out again about not wanting to be here (living), and she wants to be with her father, and she feels her life is worth nothing, and that she has no one in her life. Her mom is a drug addict, so they don't talk that much, but she is also constantly telling us she is ""not crazy"" and it's ""not the alcohol"" whenever she goes off about this whole situation when she's drinking. So yes, there's some denial going on within her as well.

Neither me nor my sister know what to do about this because you can't force someone to seek professional help if they are not willing, and so my sister has learned to just put up with her emotions regardless of how my sister-in-law acts, but this is not fair for her.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello,

There's a TL;DR at the bottom. 

My brother lives with his wife and her 15 year old son. About 2 or 3 months ago she began to experience paranoid delusions with auditory hallucinations. She thought there were cameras watching her in a particular room she spent time in. It began centralized in that single room but eventually branched out to the entire house. 

Over time, she had developed these conspiracy theories that CPS was stalking her and would take her son away. She believes there is a federal case against her. She has called the police, the FBI, and lawyers. The police gave my brother information on government mental health programs but she refuses to go because she believes they're out to get her. She will say that she's willing to get a psych evaluation but always has an excuse not to go when he brings it up. 

This weekend the situation has become more serious. My brother drove her to another city so she could take care of her father, who was recently diagnosed with late stage cancer. He found her climbing into the attic with his samurai sword trying to find some device she believed was monitoring her. He tried to take it from her and things got violent. The cops were called and her poor father was arrested. My brother picked her up and took her back home. 

She's now there being a total wreck. She won't do anything to help herself. She won't contribute. He has to do everything by himself and he's becoming far too strained. He's asked for me help in dealing with her. 

You should know that we all suspect her of abusing drugs. She has a history of drug abuse and does not have very much self control. The drugs I know she used in the past include meth and air dusters. Whippets. THC. I don't know about any others. Meth would certainly explain these symptoms. But my brother has seen no evidence. No smells. She may be eating the meth. But he doesn't know how she could be getting it. At this point it might be possible the extended drug abuse has caused permanent psychosis. I've seen that in other people. But I'm not a mental health professional. I'm a former addict and alcoholic. So I know quite a bit about drug abuse. And I've been around a lot of people with various afflictions. 

What advice can I relay to my brother in how to deal with her? How can he convince her to get a psych evaluation? He doesn't want to kick her out. 

TL;DR: My brother's wife has psychosis, paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations, conspiracy theories, and is a danger to herself, her son, and my brother. What can I do to help them? What advice can I relay to him? 

Thank you. ",Brother asked me to help him deal with his psychotic wife,1741292262.0,1j54yfd
MentalHealthSupport,"I normally wouldn't come on to a public forum like these to seek help, but due to uncontrollable circumstances im currently unable to attend therapy and these morbid thoughts have become concerningly prevalent in my life. Im truly at a loss as to what I should do and will really take any advice or support I can get right now. 

I figure to paint the fullest picture, I should give some context on me. I am diagnosed with depression, ADHD, substance use disorder, and anxiety, with a history of suicidal ideations. Some doctors have said I show signs of bipolar disorder or BPD as well. Growing up I experienced childhood sexual molestation as well as verbal, mental, and physical abuse. The verbal and mental end of this would carry out long into my teen years. I am 18F currently and because of years of drug addiction, I'm not trusted to live on my own, leaving me stuck in the house I grew up in. My life for the past year had been pretty dull, my depression would come and go in waves but for the most part I held a very close knit and quiet life. That was, up until a few months ago.

As I've been trying to remain abstinent from narcotics, I've been pushed to an isolation of sorts. I do school online and am not permitted out of the house. I don't have a door on my bedroom and I'm not trusted to administer my own medications. I have little to no access to the internet, accept for when I'm doing my school courses. Out of desperation I often go onto reddit forums or blogs instead to get a taste of social interaction. I have made plans to move out and quickly backed out of them out of fear of my guardians reaction. If it was my guess, I'd say this would be whats contributing to these recent thoughts. 

In regards to these thoughts, they range from risky to downright deadly. It started with an increase in sexual drive. I was pleasuring myself a lot and watching a lot of porn. This wasn't exactly new, I'd always been aware I had a slightly higher libido than most other girls i knew, i attributed this to a traumatic long term effect of my assault. This wasn't a problem until I began having progressively darker and darker sexual fantasies. Kidnapping, severe bodily harm, abuse, rape, and torture. These are things that put me in grave danger, yet i pursued them online. I participated in deeply risky and degrading sexual behavior and I found it hard to exude any impulse control over this. I'd post exposing photos with my ace in them on public forums, then hours later delete them when my head cleared. Then came the more morbid thoughts. I had deep intrigue on hurting and killing others. I know this is wrong and it would bring me tons of mental anguish because these werent things that ever aligned with my beliefs, but still i found it hard to stop myself from looking into these things on dangerous sites and researching ways to get away with it. These thoughts make me want to kill myself in response, but i still couldnt shake this need to keep searching and scouring for darker and darker things.  It got to the point where i was daily researching brutal crimes and watching videos on porn sites that exclusively published ideas of women being raped and tortured. 

I really do hate myself for thinking these things and doing these things, but I dont know how to make it stop. I know if i speak about it I'll be baker acted and I fear that might make things worse. I've made a pact with myself that if it came down to it, I would kill myself before I even thought about going through with something that could harm someone else. This is embarassing to even speak about and im so deeply ashamed. I don't want to publish this but im truly at a stand still and don't know what steps to take. i just need help, support, or advice. above all else im terrified.

However, I feel there have been some lasting and significant effects of that decision. I feel incredibly insecure in my facets of my life. This can be due to me getting bullied pretty regularly since I was in like junior high. But mixed with the fact that I no longer have the unconditional aspects that come along with a family, I feel even more insecure to put myself out there and to even trust people. Even with the people closest to me I feel like I’m a burden and annoying. I have a hard time deciphering whether what someone is saying is genuine or if it’s BS.

They got divorced when I was about 3 years and I stayed with mother. I got spoiled, met a bunch of her partners, she then got diagnosed with cancer and did after couple years, I was 8 at the time. About that time, my mental health issues started. Then I moved with my father and my new step mom. That started 10 year period of depression, coping mechanisms all caused by her very loving parenting and her great and open relationship with her. I run from home twice and there isn't a single person I would hate more. Also, my father really never was there for me whet it was most needed and I basically grew unable to car for myself, have coping mechanism that does not allow me to care about anything and anybody, including myself.

And that brings me to today. I moved out 4 months earlier with money I inherited. And since then, things got worse. I can't really support myself, I live of an inheritance, I fell deeper into depression and I am happy and smile only because I decided to. I don't feel anything most of the time.

MentalHealthSupport,"I've been diagnosed with a few mental health conditions, including generalized anxiety, depression, CPTSD, and bipolar disorder, although I'm uncertain about the latter diagnosis and wonder if it might be more accurate to consider ADHD or autism instead. Since childhood, I've experienced recurring, distressing 'episodes' that are often triggered by hurtful comments (It's really hurtful when things are taken out on me, especially when I haven't done anything wrong or even involved in the situation) and characterized by intense emotional turmoil, repetitive thoughts, and a strong desire to isolate myself from others. These episodes can last a few hours, and sometimes they can escalate into a bout of depression that lingers for weeks or even months. Despite having worked with a therapist for five years, I recently lost access to their services due to insurance issues, which has left me feeling uncertain and unsupported. During these episodes, I feel completely overwhelmed by my emotions, and my thoughts become fixated on phrases like 'I want to go home' or 'I'm sorry,' which play on repeat in my mind. I feel tiny, insignificant, and powerless, as if everything is pointless and nothing truly matters. Life just feels like it's too much. Yet during these episodes i can not communicate what im feeling or what i need i cant get anything else out other than ' i want to go home' or 'im sorry' Im exhausted after an episode and Eventually, I become numb and detached, feeling like a robot without any sense of purpose or passion. I also experience intense physical sensations, such as feeling like I've been stabbed in the chest or being crushed by an invisible force.

MentalHealthSupport,"I am a non-binary individual in their mid-20s, and I've been with my boyfriend for over a year now. I've always struggled with overthinking and reading into situations a bit, But it's been especially bad with this relationship. It's the first serious and intimate relationship I've ever been in, and I'd like for it to be the only one. I adore my boyfriend and he's the love of my life, despite his flaws. He's wonderful and has been so patient with me even when I've been difficult and hurtful at times in my mental illness spells. It sucks. I need to get my s*** together. I'm constantly paranoid that he's going to cheat on me or just be unfaithful - and I know a lot of these thoughts stem from me not feeling like I'm good enough or pretty enough. Though I'm non-binary, I live a woman's experience offline as I present very femininely and was assigned female at birth. (The reason I dress femininely is to help offset my dysphoria because I can't achieve the look I truly want when I try to bind, so at least dressing up pretty makes me feel more confident about myself even if it's not ideal.) Both me and my boyfriend are pan, although I think he does have a bit of a preference for girls/fems? Which I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with leaning more towards one gender with bi/pan sexualities - it's just something I've noticed with the way he talks about things and stuff, Plus I can understand being less open about same-sex attraction for men specifically considering how other guys can Be about it.

I feel ridiculous for doing this but I looked at his Instagram follows and I noticed he does follow a lot of pretty girls, some who have posted kind of scandalous images of themselves. I expressed discomfort with the idea of him receiving any type of sexual gratification from other people, even if it's just pictures/p*rn - and he says that he's been trying to stop ever since it first came up in conversation. You see, we both have struggled with hypersexuality due to trauma in our childhood (me, I've been avoidant my whole life and that makes him my first) so we're both breaking out of that addictive headspace. I guess I'm just struggling with feeling like I can trust him to keep that promise? I know it's informed by my own self-esteem issues. I just want us both to be able to be passionate and healthy about our intimate life. I don't think there's anything wrong with watching p*rn inherently, But I do think too much of it can be a bad thing cuz it does have a psychological effect on the brain. I stopped my addiction because I wanted to retrain my brain and focus all of my attention on him. And I don't know, I feel like looking at other people's scandalous posts and actively engaging with that type of content despite your partner expressing discomfort with that is disrespectful to the relationship? I believe he understands that. Again, I'm just struggling with my own internal trust.

What can I do to stop overthinking? What can I do to stop reading into every little thing and wondering if small things are red flags? I feel like TikTok has completely rotted my brain because I'm constantly getting people talking about their experiences with their partners having affairs / Reddit stories about cheating and I'm so tired. I just want to feel comfortable in my relationship. I don't think he's capable of it, though I didn't know him at the time he was totally reckless and a ""bad kid"" back in high school and because of those bad experiences he's grown up quite a lot and has a lot more experience with those type of situations, and if he didn't want to be with me we wouldn't be together planning our future 6 months in advance. He's a lovely person and I just.. can't imagine the person he is now doing that to me? But it doesn't stop the insecurities anyway. Does anyone have any grounding techniques? Or perspectives that I could consider to help me deal with this? I'm planning on going to therapy at some point this year to better help me deal with the deeper issues but, any advice/support would help. Especially because I'm pretty inexperienced with social media and relationships in general, I was always the social introvert who avoided people and just wanted to be nerdy about my interest at home so I feel like a fish out of water with this specific dynamic.

Even if the worst case scenario did happen, What can I do? I don't really have family I can ask for support for this. My friends all live busy lives and aren't familiar with the type of relationship I'm in cuz theyre like me before I got into a relationship.

I’m 21 and I have absolutely no desire to continue living. I remember first feeling this way when I was around 11-12 years old and it’s never gone away, so for me, I’ve lived most of my live depressed. Over those years I’ve taken numerous attempts on my life (taking 2 pill bottles, self harm, and intentionally crashing into a tree to name a few) and my biggest regret each time is that I wasn’t successful. I now eat one meal every couple days because if I eat more than that I throw up (typically fast food). I used to get 8 hours of sleep but I now waste my time sitting in my room all day fantasizing my own death. The last 2 years I’ve only go outside when I get in my car to go to and leave work. And even though I live with my parents, I only  talked to them every couple days, and that’s only because I run into them on my way to my room. I’ve been trying to wait for their deaths so they would Atleast think I’m going to be ok but that seems like it would take too long. I also don’t enjoy talking to people or being around them, so I slowly lost all my “friends” after school.

I know it seems like it can be fixed by eating more, getting 8 hours of sleep, reconnecting with my family and getting therapy. However I tried all these things over the course of 11-12 years (6 therapists and 2 in-patient places) and it only confirmed for me that I shouldn’t be here. I just can’t bring myself to care for anyone around me or even myself (introspection tells me it could be from an absent father). I’ve been chain-smoking and stopped working out to try to deteriorate my health but I by no means want a slow death.

What makes this situation perplexing to me is that my life isn’t particularly bad. I have a good paying job, I save and invest 80-90% of my income, and I’m respected by my peers for my work ethic. I know my parents aren’t the best, but they do what they believe is right and I know that I’m the problem in the equation. 

I feel like I have to pretend to be someone I’m not in order to get through the day. Im unable to trick myself into thinking my life is important or has any meaning even though the people around me can do it easily. I can elaborate on anything if anyone needs more details because I left a lot out that could be important and I want to hear your perspective on why you believe I’m wrong or possibly another way of thinking about it? Because even when everything is going perfect in my life, all I can think about is how I don’t want to be here.

I have been trying for over 6 years to quit. I am 21 year old male and have been trying since I was 14.5 years old. It gives me a lot of anxiety, depression, gives me headaches, fatigue, intrusive sexual thoughts, and changes my view in women to be more objectifying even though I dislike it. If you look at my post history you can tell Im a bit fucking nuts, it really affects me in a terrible way. I have been to multiple therapist by the way and am starting to think it is not trauma related as much as it is just a dopaminergic issue.

I will jerk off in my sleep (sexsomnia) if I havent had a release in awhile, get anxiety attacks, and those sexsomnia and sex dreams always cause me to relapse. 

I have tried shrooms, semaglutide, tirzepetadie, naltrexone, NAc, and other things in hopes of helping. The only thing that helps is microdosing psychedelics.

I am now waiting for an ibogaine trip as it is known as an addiction interrupter and helps people in dire scenarios. I am hoping it can help me but it is about 3.75 months away from happening so I have to wait. Then if it doesnt work I dont fucking know man. If I have a sex dream and I dont relapse I just end up having another one and my body just gives out on itself. I dont want to be doped up all the time and have erectile dysfunction and watch that horrid shit when I want to have a loving family instead.

Benzos just made it worse so i stopped. They only helped the panic that ocd itself brings because its so stressful and awful but its temporary relief and not worth what benzos come with so I told my Dr i was leaving them.

I also have a chronic GI disease and it is linked to lack of serotonin. So i decided to finally give an SSRi a try. 

I started Fluvoxamine 25mg once a day, almost a month ago. 

On week two of that, i went up to 50mg. 

Ive been there since. 
I felt better the first few days on 50mg (thoughts were still there but not as brutal which is a relief and a blessing in itself) and all of a sudden i feel incredibly down and stagnant and the thoughts are almost worsening. 

Not sure if i should stay on 50mg for a few more weeks, in the hope that itll be enough of a a dose and i just simply have to give it time?

Or is it not enough of a dose for OCD and i should just go up to 75mg for a few days, and then to 100mg?
(Id like to not go over 100mg for as long as i can for now) 

Please help. Ive heard and read and been told that im on way too low of a dose for OCD, especially OCD as severe as mine. Would really appreciate feedback from others that have actually gone through it.

MentalHealthSupport,"I, for the very first time ever in my 45 years of life, made an appointment to talk to someone. I've been overwhelmed with anxiety for...a long time. And recent events in the government have just sent my anxiety through the roof.

Really nice lady. She told me that I'm smart and funny (but I'm paying her, so I take that with a grain of salt 🤣). I told her that my go to for dealing with stress is to check out and go to a happy place in my head. I was surprised that she said that it was a good method to deal with stress (as long as I can still function normally). I think most importantly for me, she told me that when you stress about the past (whoulda, coulda, shoulda) that you're dealing more with depression. When you stress about the future and things that you can't control, it's most likely anxiety. I never made that connection and it makes so much sense!

She recommended cognitive behavioral therapy for me and mindfulness, and feels like I'm well grounded. I need to stop doom scrolling and be more present, but my daydreaming isn't as big of an issue as I thought it was.

hi ! i’m (f23) and i struggle with really bad intrusive thoughts. 

for the past 4 years, i have been stuck at home afraid of leaving the safety and comfort of my room. i unfortunately still rely on my parents because of how severe my mental health is. the intrusive thoughts i have are unpleasant and violent in nature. even though i know they’re intrusive, i still get scared to leave my room or go out in public because im afraid they will happen. i can’t even look my own family in the eye or be around them without fear of my intrusive thoughts coming true. 

because of the severity of my intrusive thoughts, i am afraid of being on my own. the thought of being alone and out in public with my horrific intrusive thoughts scare me. i know they’re just intrusive but my anxiety makes me afraid that they’ll happen. i get panicked and my hands feel numb and tingly, almost as if i have a ‘intrusive urge’ to do the intrusive thought. kind of like a compulsion to do the act itself. because of this, i avoid going anyway if necessary. 

i want to be able to support myself and have a job, go get out of the house without being afraid of myself, but i have no idea where to start. since i do not have my own money nor a car, therapy and medication isn’t accessible right now. does anyone have any advice on how to overcome this? i want to be able to live life without being afraid.

I need help…(trigger warning mentioning of r@pe,v1olence,@nimal @buse , @ddiction)

I don’t normally post on here , but my thoughts are becoming worse by the day and I don’t know how to stop it. I can’t say every single detail on here as it’ll get removed but I’ll try to add in as much as possible.

I have been experiencing extremely v1olent thoughts, as in what I want to do to people and how I want to do it, (when I say this I’m specifically talking about k11ing) this isn’t really intrusive ethier , it’s something I genuinely want to happen to these people in the moment and sometimes I want it to happen even after I’ve finnished being angry. I’ve never acted on them as such, I’ve @bused animals in the past as in $tr@nglling,hitting , and throwing.

 I have also been experiencing paranoia - seeing tall,dark shadows,faces , and last night I saw this weird doll thing in my room, all of which weren’t really there. I also constantly feel the presence of d3mons and I feel like they’re watching me and want to take my s0ul etc. the paranoia is the part that worries me the most.

Another thing I want to mention is that my brother recently has had drug induced physcosis , he started to have delusions and paranoia and he believed my dad had $a him and me when we were younger and also drogged him, he is now in a physc ward to recover. When he said this I actually  wasn’t surprised because my whole life I’ve had suspicions on my dad, I don’t even feel comfortable in the same room as him,to walk near him,to wear certain things near him,or if i see him looking at me it scares me. Basically I feel extremely uncomfortable and almost disgusted and repulsed and this has gotten 100x worse since my brothers left, to the point where I even tell my dad the violent thoughts out loud. (Telling him to 🗡️ his thr00at) that just kinda comes out my mouth because I’m so angry, it’s just such an intense anger I don’t even know how to describe it. I have always been aggressive and angry according to my parents , I’ve also suffered narc abuse and witnessed @ddiction and more in my life, serious trauma basically.

To add I also just have a strong hatred and repulse to men in general, I hate them all and have v10lent thoughts towards all of them for some reason.

Some other things I do is watch disturbing content which I find pleasurable to watch - I can’t say this in the way I actually mean cos it will get removed but hopefully people know what I’m talking about? (G00re and animal stuff again.)

Furthermore , I don’t feel any empathy or remorse for these techniques so I don’t stop to think about “how will this affect this person?” I don’t understand that at all. The only emotion I’ve felt these past 6 months or even a year is pure anger and paranoia . Although I can feel slight emotion it never lasts long and I don’t feel it as deeply as other people might. I would also like to add I’m diagnosed with adhd.

I have tried to go to the doctors and cahms and they simply do not care, they don’t really do anything to help and honestly it makes me feel even more angry, if anyone has any advice please let me know because the paranoia is really getting to me, I don’t know what’s real and what’s not.",need support / advice,1741213430.0,1j4fws7
MentalHealthSupport,"Hello, I need help or advice or guidance honestly anything that will help my mom in this situation she is in. It’s a lot and I don’t really know where to start but I have to reach out to someone because I don’t know how I can help, and I don’t want to lose my mom. My mother thinks she is a target individual who is experiencing voice to skull issues. I’m not very educated on this kind of thing but I believe and hope that it isn’t something as extreme as that and that she is experiencing schizophrenia. I have told her that I believe that it is schizophrenia, and she doesn’t believe it . I guess I will start telling you about this from the beginning because I need any answers I can get.  She has told me that she heard voices on video records I would listen to the recording and not be able to hear anything. It has progressively gotten worse . Years ago my little brother's father was sexually abusing my brother and there is much evidence of this that is easy to see. There is forensic evidence and my brother has said multiple times that he was sexually abused. My mom left the abuser and went to the police and didn’t get any kind of help. The case was mishandled and closed . Now years later after the incident they are in a custody battle. He is trying to get rights and the judge has already come to a temporary agreement that he will be able to see him on the weekends. I can only imagine how much this has affected my mom and my brother . Not very long ago my mother was dating a man who was physically and mentally abusive to her (we will call him Chad) . She has recently cut things off with Chad , but I don’t know how long that will last . The reason I have given all this backstory is because these two men are the voices she hears , as well as a woman who she believes has something to do with both of them. She has never met this woman; she's only heard her voice . Now that I’ve given you part of the backstory I can say how this is affecting her now . Not very long ago she called me in the middle of the night and said she heard glass breaking like a window breaking . I rushed over because Chad is crazy and unpredictable. I got here and there was no glass broken and no one in the house . So I stayed the night to try to make her feel more safe . About a week later I got another call from her in the middle of the night saying she believed that Chad was in the attic with some woman . She heard the voices through an app that magnifies sounds. She expressed to me that they wanted to hurt her . I came as fast as I could to make her feel better. I looked in the attic and there was nothing there and I expressed to her that I wanted her to seek professional help. She told me that she thinks that these people are fucking with her and she only hears it through some sort of technology , so she said that she is going to step back from the electronics and if she started to hear anything with out any sort of electronic device involved that she would seek help. Here we are now and she does hear voices without any sort of electronics. She also believes that my brother has some sort of v2s thing going on too . He may whisper underneath his breath some and say crazy things like “the monsters come out at night” and he asked my mother “what is someone was putting rocks in my brain and you tried to stop them by putting your head in front of mine and you started bleeding “ all of these things are definitely alarming but my brother is autistic and has a horror fascination. I don’t know what to do. I am the only one she has told about all of this and it is a lot and I don’t know how I can help but she has told me she thinks about ending it . She cries so many times a day. She said they have the power to make her get sick or to go to the bathroom. They control her completely. They also make commentary about her life and what she does. For example, she was washing her clothes and the woman she hears said your clothes are ugly. They laugh at her and make her second guess anything and everything. She is thinking about being with Chad again; she says they will brainwash her into being with him again. He is an abusive man and it is not a good idea for them to be together but she says what if I don’t have any control over it . This morning she woke up and said to me that as she was waking up they showed her images and white letters . I’m not sure what the images were or what the letters were spelling, but I do know I need my mom around she is such a big part of my life and I can’t imagine my life without her so thank you for reading this far and please if you have any advice or information that will benefit us please let me know .

I'm very confused about if I'm spacing out or if I'm actually dissasociating sometimes. I'm not sure if the cause is a lack of sleep or to do with having a vitamin D defiency or anything. I have really a terrible memory and it doesn't happen too often so I'll describe my experiences as best I can

Sometimes I'll go super lightheaded for like a second kind of like feeling I'm falling for a split second but staying on the ground- basically what I'd imagine your soul leaving your body to feel like (That's the best way I can describe it). Then sometimes my brain will feel kind of fuzzy but I can still talk and stuff just something doesn't feel quite right (This lasts either a few seconds or minuets so not very long, it also usually happens basically out of nowhere too). I tried describing it to my parents and they said it was probably just a lack of sleep or staying inside all day which make sense but I'm not sure if I trust their answers about mental health questions or anything like this because they seem to switch between 'you're just a teenager' and 'it's mental health' quite a lot which doesn't help with my confusion at all. I really want to know if whatever I'm dealing with is genuinely mental health or just regular teenage issues. (Sorry that went a little off-topic)

for additional info: i’ve been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and have been taking medication for it since birth

i’ve also been having suicidal ideation, nearly every day. no intent though, but just thinking about a clear way i could end my life and how my family would react afterwards. i low-key fantasize about it a lot. (just an fyi, i don’t do any psychotherapy or any kind of mental health care.)

i’m having a physical in two weeks, should i finally answer truthfully on the mental health questionnaire about my depression and suicidal thoughts?

i would also like being prescribed antidepressants or being referred to psychotherapy. however, i think in CA, a parent has to consent to psychotropic drugs and a minor cannot. im pretty sure my mom or dad will consent. i am anxious though that my parents won’t actually follow through and take me to a therapist even with the referral.

again, i’m not that worried they’ll do anything serious about the depression. but they will probably take me to the ER (and afterwards possibly a psych hospital) for my suicidal thoughts. i would like for this to happen. however, my parents will flip out and will probably get so mad at me.

any advice? my parents are really spiritual, so they don’t believe in mental health care. i’m scared to be honest to my GP in front of my mom. (shes the one that’s gonna go with me to the appointment). i’m also not worried about insurance too much because i’m covered by Medi-Cal.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi guys I never usually have the mental energy to write this but have wanted to for a long time and I have it now so using it while I got it ha. Bit of rough context because this is too long to get into fully. I’m 24yr old female, family has history of genetic mental illness from my dad’s side and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder from a young age (which my dad also has). At 17 I was also diagnosed with autism which was a developmental set back to say the least having to relearn myself, caused a lot of confusion on top of the struggles I already faced. Anyway I’m sure I don’t need to get into the ins and outs of what I go through on a daily basis for my life as I’m sure most on this sub already know. I’m now medicated on a medication that really helps - me and my dad are on the same thing and I’m much better than I was but of course - there’s no cure for what I have and that’s okay I’m learning as I go to manage things. Point is im a lot better now, I’ve struggled in life too financially I’ve been SA twice once quite as child and once in adult life, been homeless been pushed into a stage of prostitution in order to pay rent all of these I’m not proud of but we are dealt the cards we are dealt and my past does not define my future. 

Anyways context over - I met a guy, we got together my life has drastically improved and changed. I’ve always lived away from family since 16 and although the relationship is better now I’m used to living away and I prefer it this way. I moved up north (England) to live with him. I’m isolated from family (again nothing changed) and friends (although I already lived away from them and never been good at making new friends) so nothing changed from the isolation really. We are a year and a bit in and we’ve bought our first home which is insane, I have a stable home for myself and my 2 cats. We got a dog who I adore and I’ve always wanted. I have a lot really and I’m so greatful for the opportunity and stability he’s brought into my life. My family adore him (which is a first completely and very strange for me) he loves my family, I like his and care for his too. 
It’s an ideal situation on paper. But I’m currently fighting for dear fucking life.

I love him and I don’t want to lose him, when we are good we are great but the reality is I’m not good all the time. This is the first relationship I’ve ever been in where I’ve felt alone and unloved. It’s really altered myself. I’ve been in relationships constantly which isn’t good but it’s understandable when I analyse my behaviour based on past experiences. I crave that close connection, love and protection and well friendship that I’ve never truly experienced. It’s a deep need that if I have to fix - I’m not sure I want to yet. I’ve been known as very tough and cold on the exterior as I put up a barrier I suppose for protection. I’ve always been in fight mode so relationships for me was this chance to let my guard down and just breathe and feel safe. You could say I’ve been with people sort of similar to myself the ‘bad boy’ type exterior but so kind and soft with me although they would publicly show it. And I adored it. I should also mention I’ve left everyone except one in my relationships and broke them. I suppose I run away or feel like I need more which I know isn’t healthy. I wasn’t going to get into another relationship until I found “the one” as in the one who was right for me and the one to share my life with. I thought I’d met him. And I’m unsure now. The issue with us which I’ve seen is I still feel like I’m in fight mode and I don’t have the support around me to give me what he doesn’t. If I’m low or sad deeply hurt he doesn’t do what I need to support me. There’s a lack of empathy there completely and if I bring it up he says “that’s just me”. I’ve done so much growth mentally and spiritually and I can recognise when his ego is in the way instead of acting out of love and care. He’s had a rough childhood and dealt with it through blocking emotions out but when we first got together I saw so much that “wasn’t him”. He was kind, attentive a good listener, he looked in love. He still is all those things but only if I’m ‘happy’ and if I talk about something that’s bothering me or if I struggle as I did last night with suicidal thoughts he goes blank.

Last night for example a build up of emotions came up I felt overwhelmed and stressed about a lot in life and not following my path I wanted to in my career and I broke down completely. I couldn’t see a way out, he had a good day and I spoke to him about it he didn’t know what to say he hugged me. But I needed to talk not to be touched. I called my mum because I needed help and was scared, I bawled my heart out on the phone while both mum and dad tried to talk to me and showed concern and care. He just made spag bowl next to me like he didn’t care at all. He brought me some food after which was nice but I needed help and needed him to talk to me but instead we watched tv my eyes still swollen and chest aching and ignored it. Because I needed him there and I didn’t want to ruin it.

I went to the kitchen and started cleaning up still holding my pain in, I was cleaning because I had a lot to do in the morning and I can’t do it with mess. He came in and spoke to me with arrogance about something and snarked at me. I just flipped chucked the kitchen roll at the wall I had in my hand and burst into floods of tears telling him not to talk to me like that when I’m on the edge of hope. Where is your kindness. 

I walked away got in the shower bawled my heart out and tried to slice down my arms with razors. I haven’t done that since I was 16. It broke me that I was led to this, I couldn’t get far because I couldn’t get the razor blade out the case, I covered up and stepped outside and he was on the sofa on his phone. I proceeded to cry in bed then went numb and stone cold. He eventually got into bed and said nothing with me holding in tears again and hyperventilating. I couldn’t sit there while he listened to me cry it was humiliating, so I went in the living room to sleep and cry. He eventually came in and asked what I’m doing, we spoke which basically consisted of him saying my reaction pissed him off and he needed space and telling me to come to bed. I tried to explain that it hurts you feel pissed at me for reacting to the way you spoke to me when you’ve heard and felt my pain this whole evening.

Anyway long story short convo went stagnant he made me get into bed cuddled me kissed me and went to sleep. Side note: had a dream that I was in a toilet cubicle taking a shit and I could see someone’s feet behind the door, they broke in and pulled me away with my pants down and we had a fight lol. I’m guessing this means I felt extremely vulnerable and exposed from last night. That or I needed a shit.

So here we are this morning and he acts completely normal, kisses me and goes to work while I stay working from home (when I should t) and blag a migraine. 

I don’t know where to go what to do I can’t leave him even if I wanted to, I have nowhere to go and no money so I suppose what I’m asking is how do I give myself a support network internally, is there a way?

MentalHealthSupport,"I am a nineteen year old male and have been living with depression and anxiety since I was 14. For the past year and so since graduating I have been struggling immensely with motivating myself to do anything. I am currently in therapy one day every two weeks, I find it helps, yet I have suicidal thoughts every day. 

My parents pressure me to find a job often, and rightfully so, I only work one day a week  and I would like to find a part-time job, but I find it so incredibly difficult to make myself do anything. I also worry things will get worse if I feel even somewhat as mentally exhausted as I do after one day of work. I currently won’t even do or try to accomplish things I enjoy anymore. I’ve expressed my desire to achieve something with my life but also my feeling that my life is hopeless and fated to end with suicide or failure. I feel as though I’m just laying idle because I’m afraid of death and want to be as close to it as I can without actually committing suicide.

I want to die but to also succeed and my parents get frustrated with that contradiction and say I don’t actually want to die, which could be true but I’ve thought and planned out death before.

I would also like to go to University for English Literature, but every time I start the application process I get overwhelmed, anxious and nihilistic at attempting to figure out the process. We are currently attempting to look for an ADHD diagnosis since we’ve expected I’ve had it since I was young. I also  messed up a lot in High School and now have to upgrade a course for university and it’s gotten much more stressful and overwhelming to me for that. Not to mention even more damaging to my already weak self-image.

I feel so incredibly overwhelmed by life right now and like I’m a complete failure for my lack of a proper job, a pursuit in my interests, or going to university.
I feel like life is not capable of getting better and it’s my fault for not motivating myself to do anything. Suicide is prominent on my mind and it frightens me that it feels like the easiest option for me.

MentalHealthSupport,"CW: mention of S.H

Sorry to the mods if you remove this. I understand :)

I am 19.
I don’t have any diagnosed conditions and I am not seeking one. This is more of a vent than asking for help.

When I was 15, I didn’t have friends, not real ones, I was in the process of coming out as transgender, and in the middle of lockdown. I was, as you can imagine, very hormonal, very angsty and sad. I wasn’t bullied, just very insecure and unhappy. I decided that S H was the way to go. I wasn’t suicidal, I didn’t want to die, I just didn’t want to be sad anymore. I did this for around a year. In 30c weather (heatwave in the UK), I would be wearing black hoodies and black jeans. I struggled but made it through, playing it off that it was because I was trans and didn’t want to see my chest so much, which was very true but not the reason.
Eventually, I stopped. I waited for my scars to heal before I told my parents what I had been doing and they were very understanding.

It had been 4 years since I’d done so.

Had.

I don’t mean to sound like I’m bragging or proud of that because I’m really disappointed in myself. 4 years. I was okay for 4 years. I coped for 4 years. And now it’s all gone. Can I just not count this instance? It was a one time slip up.

I don’t understand why I did it. I’m not depressed, just having a hard time. I am having a bad time at work, finding the motivation to actually do what I’m supposed to when I’m there. I get to work fine, and I’m happy but I just can’t actually do what I need to do, I just stand around waiting for things to just happen themselves I guess. People at work re starting to hate me because I’m lazy. They constantly whisper like I’m not even there. I’m searching for a new job but I just keep getting rejection emails, even with 2 years experience. The other day, I handed my notice in to my boss, gave myself a month to find new work. He called me into the office to talk, and I just cried. I wasn’t going to cry, I was going to be angry and yell about all the problems at work, like I said in my letter. But, my boss. He is an excellent man, he just told me to think bout it, listened to what I could actually say and told me he would be checking up on me. Asked if there was anything else going on that’s not work related. I told him that it’s just everything, I couldn’t think/say anything specific. I mean, I have had 6 months of 3pm-10pm shifts. And there is no end in site. I haven’t had more than a week off all together since November, which doesn’t sound like that long but before that, I’d saved my holiday hours from the entire year for 4 weeks off paid. I had surgery abroad and needed recovery time. I didn’t want to come back but I needed money because even now, I still owe £2500 for my surgery. 
I think part of why I am so unhappy at work isn’t excactly because of work. I come home and it’s not much better. Our house is now more mould and damp than actual house. My bedroom currently has a leak in the roof, which has now allowed for fucking mushrooms to grow up there. Mushrooms. And I can’t afford to do anything about it. I’ve tried clearing out the mould as much as possible, I’ve tried wiping down every surface, I have a dehumidifier going 24/7 but nothing helps. I’ve given up on it. I gave up a while ago actually. I don’t bother cleaning up because even if I do, it looks horrible still. The other day, I had to throw things in my own way, so I’d be motivated to clean up. Even then I only cleaned up the stuff on the floor. 
I haven’t showered in 3 days, haven’t brushed my teeth in over a week. And I just fucked up after 4 years.


I should go to a doctor, seek out a diagnosis, but part of me is saying that medically, there is nothing wrong with me, that I’m just being lazy, and I’m happy a lot of the time, so I can’t have anything wrong with me. But most of the time, I’m only really happy when I’m around other people. Most of the time I don’t really feel anything. I don’t really feel sad, just… a bit like this 🫤 not sad, not happy. Just…I exist.

I have an online friend who’s going through a really hard time — with their parents, with life, with everything. They tell me they’re going to therapy and that it’s helping, but at the same time, they often text me really dark and heavy things. It’s not new for me, and I always try my best to respond with support and reassurance, but sometimes it feels like nothing I say actually helps.

I’ve told them that the only way forward is to push for change — to step outside their comfort zone, even when it’s hard — because staying in the same place, just complaining about how unfair life is, won’t make anything better. But I know that’s easier said than done.

What makes this more complicated is that this is an online friendship. People have told me before that I might never meet them, and that all I can do is offer words — whether they take my advice or not is up to them. Still, I can’t shake the guilt I feel when I can’t seem to help them.

I’m starting to realize that while I care about them and want to support them, it’s not my responsibility to fix their life. I want to be there for them, but it’s overwhelming at times — especially when I’ve been in their shoes before.

So, I’m wondering — how do I set boundaries without feeling like I’m abandoning them? How can I remind myself that their healing isn’t solely on me?

I digress. I’ve been dealing with what I think is either dissociation or derealization. It’s been happening for 4-5 days now.

I feel a constant sense of confusion, it feels as if nothing around me is actually happening. Time feels kinda fast and I’m constantly in my mind. It feels kinda as if I’m trapped in my head, huddled in a dark, cold room. Alone. I have memory issues and can’t completely remember what I did, I have to really focus on trying to remember. I’m actively here but kinda not really? I also feel kinda static-y…like physically it feels like static, fuzzy.

I seem to snap out of it for a few seconds while playing games with friends or hanging out with people, even shaking my head a little bit hard can work, but it only lasts for a few seconds, maximum a single minute. I can’t remember why it started or when it started, I only remember it starting sometime last week.

Honestly if I had to explain it, it’s kinda similar to greening out.

My little sibling has DID, and I love every single part of them. Recently, something happened and the original alter/host split about 32 times. The others were able to piece them back together but right after that they split in two again. My sibling has the kind of DID where all of the alters come from the original alter, and they all really rely on them. Every time they’ve split, it’s never actually gotten rid of an alter before, but this time it did. One of the alters recently tried to kill themself because the system couldn’t function without their original. I know which alters are from the original, and neither of them like fronting much nor do they have much of an identity, and we know it’s possible to merge alters back into one but… we don’t know how. I want to help them so much because all of the alters are slowly starting to lose themselves, and we’re scared that eventually everyone is going to keep splitting to try and escape. 

Does anyone know how we can get the two new alters to merge back? Or at least some way to get the old one back?

I also daydream like 24/7 which has been happening for YEARS its to the point where I can’t control my daydreaming and it consumes like 99% of my day to the point where I don’t feel like I’m living my life properly 
Unstable relationships where I can love someone and then really hate them quickly 
A lot of what I experience happens on a daily 

I feel like therapy has helped me understand like what triggers my emotions, understanding that my daydreaming is like “keeping me safe” however what I don’t understand is why I daydream everyday like what is it protecting me from. Most of these things I’m experiencing are probably normal for a teenager but I just feel isolated to how I feel because I don’t know anyone who feels like I do. 

For background info: I’ve been through a lot of childhood trauma which has affected me a lot and I have been through more things that have also impacted me. Both my parents are on medication for their mental health so maybe it’s something genetic?? 

If someone could just give me advice on what I should do about this i would be very grateful!

I've never truly loved anyone, not family, friends, or partners.  I haven't felt a genuine connection with anyone. I've had relationships, but they've been primarily for my own benefit. I've manipulated people without fully realizing the impact of my actions. 

Now, I find myself constantly trying to please others.  I'm overly critical and hold grudges, harboring resentment.  I've lost sight of who I am, feeling like I have multiple personalities, each a reflection of what others expect.  I present a different version of myself to everyone, and no one, including myself, knows the real me. This fear of not knowing myself is terrifying.

MentalHealthSupport,"I am 22F. I was recently diagnosed with narcolepsy after struggling with debilitating sleep issues that worsened over the last year. I just started a new med (modafinil) on the 1st for that. I was also \*diagnosed\* with endometriosis in December (did not receive surgery, but met with surgeon to discuss options where she told me she was 100% certain that I had stage 4 bowel endometriosis. I am not able to get the surgery any time soon).I

I've struggled with mental health issues since I was 12 (bipolar 2 and ADHD). I am usually medicated, but had to get off of all of my meds to get the narcolepsy diagnosed. I had to stay off of the medicine in order to take the new medicine for the narcolepsy. 

I am struggling with life right now. Last year, (before both narcolepsy and endometriosis diagnoses) I had a pretty solid plan for my future. I was loving college (sophomore), super excited to pursue my career. I figured out what exactly I want to pursue and where I want to pursue it (marine biology at CSUMB in California), and I was genuinely hopeful and excited for my future. I knew I had health issues, but they were kinda easier to pretend I didn't have because there was no specific diagnosis set in stone. 

 I am pretty poor, but I had just enough in savings to justify moving to the college in California to study (was gonna take out a few loans too). I then got in a minor car accident that cost me about $2000 of my savings, and had other expenses that had to come out of savings vs income. I am full time in school, and I was working two jobs to make ends meet and save money for this future I had planned. I had to quit my one job because it was too physically demanding and I couldn't do it anymore. I now have pretty much 0 hope of ever being able to afford to move to my dream school, and I cannot pursue marine science in the Midwest where I currently live. 

I had also started talking to a guy who I genuinely thought could end up being The One (cheesy, sorry) and it didn't work out due to our busy schedules and just general miscommunication. I told him on my end I was willing to reconnect if he got less busy, but he didn't seem all too interested. I am left feeling even more lonely than before, as I got so hopeful that things would work well because they had been going amazingly the whole time up until the abrupt end. 

Due to the recent health diagnoses, I have struggled in school to the point where I have probably skipped at least 1/3 to 1/2 of all of my classes since January 14th. I am not learning or retaining information, I cant focus, I am too tired from the narcolepsy to even get out of bed to go to class. I am considering doing a medical withdrawal because I just cannot function. 

I am now at one of the lowest points in my life. I lost a lot of my savings, I had to quit a job, I found and lost a potential partner, I don't have a solid support system. (My mom died when I was 15, my dad is abusive and absent, rest of my family doesn't speak to me. I have friends but I feel like I am always a second option or just someone they will talk to/spend time with ONLY if they have no one else. ) I feel like I cannot pursue my dream career, so college feels pointless. I am in pain every day from the endometriosis, but I cannot get surgery because I have no support system or way to pay for my life when taking off work for said surgery. Plus, my case is complex in the sense of they cannot guarantee me that surgery would help at all. I am constantly exhausted too, and I have barely gotten enough sleep since January 10th when I started weaning off my meds to begin the narcolepsy diagnostic journey. 

I know being off of my mental health meds is seriously screwing me up and making me catastrophize. But I genuinely sit here and feel like my life has fallen apart. The only thing that keeps me going is that I have a dog and a cat who need me to care for them. I just genuinely have nothing super positive to hold onto, nothing fun or exciting to hold onto. I am just surviving, and I am so sad all the time. 

I am not sure what I am trying to gain from this, but I just feel so painfully alone. I feel like I could disappear and nobody would be affected. I just wish there was a solution to any of my problems but I cannot figure anything out. I am so young and I am so hopeless, and I don't know what to do anymore. 

I am just so tired. I wish I had someone in my life who would be there with me through this, who could go to DR appointments and hold me when I am falling apart. I don't have anyone for that. I try to talk to people about this stuff but I can tell it overwhelms them, so I have been trying not to talk about it as much. I have never had a support system though, so I have not really processed much of the issues in my life. 

It just feels like no matter how hard I try, things keep getting worse. I don't know what other steps to take beyond the ones I am currently taking. I guess this is a rant, because I don't know what anyone else could offer me in terms of solutions. Life is hard. 

**What I am doing to try and help myself:** treating narcolepsy with modafinil, but the side effects so far are brutal. treating endometriosis with pelvic floor therapy, general pain meds, supplements, but it doesn't help much. I have a therapist for general issues, and a new therapist for relationship issues (the situation with the guy really messed me up more than it should, and made me seek treatment for my previous traumatic experiences). I am going to try to get on a new mood stabilizer for my bipolar, and I am hoping the modafinil helps the ADHD due to it being a stimulant. I am trying to focus on my hobbies and start new ones. I have also bought some books and am trying to start journaling again.

MentalHealthSupport,"FOR CONTEXT: I'm a full time college student. I really, really don't want to deal with my family's issues. I'm trying to grow up and live my own life. But the current circumstances are stealing all my peace, making me constantly tense and worried. Not only that, I have my own mental health shit going on; I've been so depressed lately.

I posted this on another sub, I'm trying to get as much advice as possible. So here's the lowdown:

He's 27m, lives in rural Arizona with his roommate and his roommate's mom. Has ADHD and Level 1 autism (previously known as Asperger's). Did ketamine for a while. Is always changing his ADHD meds, it seems. Has had a problem with weed in the past, don't know how much he still uses it.

So I can't tell his whole life story right now, but growing up was very rough for him and our family was rather dysfunctional. He blamed religion for the dysfunction. Every time I talked to him on the phone he would complain about our parents' religion and how it ruined his life and how God doesn't exist, that sort of thing.

All that suddenly changed in literally two hours. One evening he was having one of his usually family phone calls, complaining about religion. Then he called back and suddenly believed in God again. Out of nowhere. And suddenly he's all like ""my parents are my saviors."" Very weird.

All week, he's been calling and texting our parents to ramble on and on about religion and God. My parents have been praying for YEARS for him to stop being an atheist and come back to God, so of course, they were delighted. I was the only one who had a sinking feeling about the whole situation. It was too sudden.

Sure enough, yesterday he had a full-blown psychotic break and his roommate's mom had to call an ambulance. He ran away from the ambulance into the desert. Was having paranoia and delusions and being unsure whether he was in heaven or hell. He's back from the hospital but it seems like nothing has changed. He's saying some really disturbing things, like a schizophrenic person would say. Like he doesn't know where he is or what's going on.

But my parents? They don't seem all that concerned. They're still trying to ""evangelize"" him. They insist that God is using his mental health episode to bring him back from atheism.

I'm just really scared for him because I don't know what happened. It's like he transformed into a completely different person.

Since I have religious parents, of course they're just focusing on the ""he's now religious!"" part instead of the psychosis part. Trying to convince them that this isn't normal or OK for him is like talking to the wall. It almost seems like they're taking advantage of this.

Being far away from him is hard. It doesn't help that his roommate's mom, who's been keeping us updated, is ill with Parkinson's and can't really be a caregiver. I don't know what to do.

Got any thoughts about what might be going on? I feel kind of like I'm screaming into the void here.

MentalHealthSupport,"I’m 27 and my sister is 25. We’ve been extremely close our entire lives and because of a complicated childhood I’ve often taken a more maternal role to her and our other siblings.

Last week my sister attempted to take her life. She was admitted to inpatient treatment for what was supposed to be a 72 hour hold. She called me today crying and panicking because they told her she could either rescind her 201 and agree to stay longer or there would be a hearing tomorrow morning to have her committed. I told her I would speak to her nurse and find out more about what’s going on.

Well I spoke with the nurse. She hasn’t participated in her care since she got there. She’s refusing to attend group, doesn’t engage in therapy, isn’t eating or taking medication, and won’t make a plan for after discharge. She doesn’t have insurance so she can request a lateral transfer to another facility but it’s very unlikely it would be approved. After speaking with the nurse I called my sister back and tried to explain her options. She was furious that I couldn’t get her discharged. In our 10 minute conversation, she threatened to take her life 3 times before hanging up on me and then letting her team know they’re no longer allowed to discuss her care with me.

I found out shortly after that while speaking with her husband, she told him if she couldn’t leave inpatient tonight she would kill herself. I fought with myself for a while before making the very hard decision to call the hospital and let them know what she’s said and that she may be looking for a way to harm herself.
I know my sister. She’s likely giving them the silent treatment hoping this will go away, which means the hearing will happen tomorrow morning, where she’ll find out I told them what she said, and that I agree she needs to be held for further treatment.

I’m sick. I’m terrified she’s going to find a way to hurt herself. The thought of her lying in that bed thinking she’s being held against her will for no reason is breaking my heart.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hello, I’m new to this type of thing (reddit, SA and support groups). I’m a 24 year old man and came to the realisation talking to my cousin about childhood trauma yesterday that I may have been SA’d as a child but I’m not exactly sure. 

Basically what happened is, last year while watching the menendez brothers series, Erik (I think) spoke about how his brother abused him but made it out to be “a game” so he thought it was normal. While watching that it triggered a memory of my own involving myself and my childhood neighbour who was older than me. 

I would have been 7-8 at the time, my neighbour being 12-16 (I don’t remember exactly). Over at his house playing Star Wars, I was a captured Jedi. He was playing the role of the enemy and to determine whether I was Jedi or sith he needed to inspect my genitalia for a “marking”. He proceed to touch and look, I felt very weird about it but when along with the “game”. 

Another time, we were playing at his house our play ended up in his bathroom. I can’t remember exactly how or what led to this but he wanted to play a game where we would touch eachother. We each took our pants off and he proceeded to touch and jiggle my butt while I faced the other way, he wanted me to do the same, I wasn’t so keen on doing so. After his mother walked in asking what we were doing, I don’t remember much other than feeling like I was in trouble or had done something wrong.

Both of these moments happened not long after the other, I can also remember somewhere before or after the 1st time, he introduced me to porn.

Nearly 20 years later I feel confused about the situation, a little in denial whether it was SA or not and angry about the situation almost as if my innocence was stolen.

MentalHealthSupport,"Best way to support my suicidal partner

Hi all,

My partner has depression and since mid January he has basically made up his mind that he wants to die. The suicidal thoughts come in waves it seems of overwhelming and medium, but he never seems to have a moment where he thinks that he might want to live or get better. We are currently having daily visits from the crisis team and he is locked in at home with all the harmful things locked away. On the occasion he goes outside with supervision, he regularly tries to run to the railway to end his life. I have prevented him running each time.

We are from the UK and he is currently waiting for mind resilience and stabilisation and also NSH talking therapy, but neither appears to be getting any closer and he still hasn't been allocated a care coordinator. He has autism, ADHD, PTSD and depression.

I want to support him but I don't know how to help someone that doesn't want help. He thinks it is hopeless. But I know suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. And he will be glad I stopped him doing it eventually. But I just don't know what to do.

I'm trying to read self help books and remain positive for him but idk. I'd like some advice on how to help him turn around and start healing. And maybe I'd like to hear some success stories to help bolster my hope for him.

Sorry if this sounds extremely disjointed, but I am trying to convey a great deal of information without TL:DR.


I have lived in a city that has proved very destructive to my mental health.
  I have been here 13 years. In the last 10 years A.W. ( alias ) has been attaching himself to me. If I see him, I wave or greet him. He might do something like be to busy to visit, or will wake me as I am half asleep in the local mall and listening to audio stories.
  He went on for hours.

As I interrupted him m and asked if he was going to speak in an organized way so I would not be so exhausted by his *company, he spoke very disjointed as he had been for the last 2 hours.

 Conversation was exactly like this.

.........,,
God is good.
Iditorod.
I I I.
Different.
I didn't use to be this way.
Tennis tennis - instructor

The more we can work together.
Alex , Evans, Peter.
......

 Now I don'tean to be uncaring like the self-centeredness of the rest of humanity, but this troubles Me.

  I judge him to be schizophrenic. I don't want to run away when I see him. His encounters with me have been self-serving. In the middle of my ketoacidosis, I asked him to help me to shop, but he had ""no time for it"".
Yet, he talks about how he wants to roommate with me, or some other time burden, and soaked NG up my time with spinning one way conversations like above.

  I desire to help, but also protect my own boundaries and mental health.

All the above being background; I am frustrated by the advice from others how I should interact with A.W. 
  The suggestions I have been told are:
Avoid Direct confrontation: Don't try to ""prove"" their beliefs wrong.

[ He fantasizes about completing his degree in biology, in spite of not being able to strong a coherent sentence together. ]

And yet, people tell me
What I should do:

Ask how you can help:

Let them know you are there to support them and ask what they need.

Offer practical assistance:

Help with daily tasks like cooking, cleaning, or taking medication reminders if needed.

Engage in simple activities:

..,....,
I say to those reading this, I see no way this helps him, other than enabling his problems.

  It unnecessarily burdens me, with A.W. s string of demands, ludicrous expectations ( let's be roommates ) or using up my time.

My question I pose to you,'ll: What can I do to help A.W.? What can I do to help me? What is my moral obligation?

I was diagnosed with depression bipolar 2 at 12, I am now almost 25 and diagnosed with a mood and personality disorders, and it’s been a constant struggle to say the least. However, I can say without a doubt that I have never been this low or desperate for escape. I spent time keeping myself going with the little things in life, how the loss of my life would affect my loved ones, all the sweet memories I have, all the memories I’ll make, and so on. When that stopped working, I started telling myself that I have no choice but to stay alive. Like what else am I going to do except get out of bed and keep going? I’ve been to therapy, I recently stopped seeing my therapist due to me moving states, however I did recently “graduate” from an intensive outpatient program. I should not have left the program. I am not better— at all. 

I’m looking for a therapist and even made an appointment with an office to discuss a more urgent medicinal therapy. But I don’t have the energy anymore, wholeheartedly. I made the appointment and research therapists as an obligation to others. And I don’t care to keep trying. I know I’d be considered selfish, and I don’t care. I know it’ll tear people apart, but I can barely breathe. I am sobbing probably 5 hours of the day, every single day. I can hardly stomach food anymore. I haven’t been able to hold a conversation in years. I can barely interact with the herbal public positively. And I don’t know how to get intervention if I don’t really want it. My insurance isn’t great, I work 40+ hours a week, I’m broke, and I’m over it.

MentalHealthSupport,"Hi, I struggle everyday with chronic fatigue, pain, depression and a lot of other mental and physical health issues. I want to get better but I don’t know how to explain really how stuck I feel. I can’t put in the work because I constantly feel paralysed and terrified of life. I often express that I think the best thing for me would be to disappear into a cabin in the middle of nowhere for a few months and just exist slowly, but that’s not really realistic for me personally. 

So my question is, is there a place in existence (that isn’t a trip to the grippy sock facility) where someone can go for a couple weeks to a couple months to detox their brain from itself? I’m not quite sure how to put what I need into a concrete business description, but there must be something out there that isn’t a “wellness retreat” in the Buzz Word way, but is geared towards people in burnout.

Basic Info:
	•	Age: 23
	•	Gender: Male (questioning, which triggered a mental health crisis)
	•	Location: USA (Cincinnati, OH)
	•	Medication: None (I do 🌿 to quiet my thoughts and help process them)
	•	Background: Raised in a conservative homeschool Christian environment, but my perspective has flipped over the last five years.

Mental Health History:
I felt trapped growing up, unable to have my own identity. I struggled with suicidal ideation and was groomed, which worsened things. The worst period lasted 3-4 years, where I withdrew completely and barely made it through each day.

As a child and teen, I was overwhelmed by darkness with only brief moments of clarity. I never expected to live to 18. But when I did, it was like a switch flipped—both the highs and lows disappeared. I could still feel emotion, but only neutrality, anger, brief excitement, and a newfound hope for the future.

I lived like that until I met my partner. We were long distance until I moved closer to her four months ago. We saw each other many times before that, but I couldn’t keep driving 8.5 hours each way every month. While with her she has reignited a passion and love I thought I was incapable of feeling.

Where I’m at now:
Since moving out of my family’s home, I’ve realized my past struggles weren’t gone—they were repressed. Now they’re coming out in bad ways: emotional breakdowns, uncontrollable crying, dissociation, paranoia, and suicidal ideation. I keep cycling through:
	•	Clarity, contentment, and ease.
	•	Depression, emotional instability, and spiraling.
	•	Paranoia, curiosity, and intense self-discovery.
	•	Dissatisfaction and intrusive thoughts, including drastic urges.

I want to get gender counseling and maybe affirmative care, but I need to stabilize first. My goal is to be my best self for my partner and to find consistent happiness rather than feeling like I’m always on the verge of a breakdown.

Seeking Advice:
I don’t know if I should see a counselor, a psychiatrist, or just change my lifestyle. Money is tight. Any recommendations for affordable support in the Cincinnati area? Or advice for managing this on my own?

MentalHealthSupport,"I could probably write a whole book about my life but I cannot because nobody is really willing to help and I get it because people have their own problems and that is okay

Basically I was taken away from my mom and dad when I was 12 months old and moved in with my aunt and uncle. My aunt was abusive and my cousin who I lived with teased me constantly. When I was 5 I moved in with my dad but he never really got his life together. He always said he was sober but he kept drinking for a while. That did not really bother me at first but one night when I was 12 he choked me because he found out I had smoked cigarettes. The crazy part is it was a long time after I actually did it and he was drunk when it happened

When I was 15 about to turn 16 I tried to kill myself and when I got out my dad said something so harmful to me that I ran away and moved in with my mom. My mom has a learning disability and she is super manipulative. She constantly asks me for money and always tries to guilt trip me into giving it to her.

The living conditions here are awful. I live with my mom and my older brother in a house full of mice. The windows are busted out because my mom angered me to that point. Now I feel like I cannot even think straight because I am not even thinking for myself anymore. The worst part is I am terrified that if I move out I will be alone and miserable. But now I can't even tell anyone the problem when I see them because I have so many thoughts constantly racing. There's spiders everywhere, roaches, a bunch of dogs and cats, only 2 bedrooms for the entire trailer, water bmbarley works, heat almost never works, etc.

People say you can choose your friends as family but friends always get married and have kids and then they do not have time for you either

If I leave I know my mom will not be able to pay her rent and her car and I really believe she will try to kill herself if I go. I tried talking to my brother about moving out before but he lies and acts like there is no problem so it just leaves me even more confused

I never called the cops on my dad or my mom because no matter what I still loved them so I was never able to actually tell the truth in therapy. Now I just turned 18 last month and I am scared for my future because I have no idea what to do. I don't want to stay with my mom because I can't handle her unless I lived a lie like my brother but I am against lying and value authenticity.

MentalHealthSupport,"!!TW!!!  If you want to reply, feel free. I just need to get this off my chest. First of all, I've lived with emotionally and physically abusive family members. For as long as I could remember, I was always the odd one out. I never fit in no matter how hard I tried. I'm 22 now, turning 23 this year. A few months ago, I was blessed with the opportunity to move out. Now I don't have the best job, I don't even have a car BUT I just couldn't let the chance to finally escape pass me by. In my state, rent for a one bedroom apartment normally starts at $1200. The place that was offered to me is a room in a house, and its only $650 a month which includes utilities, wifi, etc. Imo, that's a steal. 

My issue is that I keep getting in my own way. I'm in constant fight or flight mode and currently trying to execute ""flight."" I'm so scared to use the help and resources I have because I feel undeserving of help. I have too much pride and want to do it all myself so I can feel like a ""real adult.""  Being a real adult is accepting that I don't have to carry and do everything by myself. I love being independent, but it definitely comes at a cost. 
I started moving my things today while nobody was home, and now in a few hours when the sun comes up (for me its almost 3am as I write this) I'll have to figure out a way to move my heaviest boxes down a huge flight of stairs by myself. I want to use my mother's truck but I'm afraid of backlash. I plan on refilling the truck with gas when I'm done using it, so it shouldn't be a big deal. However, I'm still walking on eggshells around everyone because if I make one wrong move or even BREATHE wrong; I'm getting sh*t on.  

This has to be one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. I love my family, but for years I've been treated as their doormat. Not anymore. I can't do it anymore. I'm stuck in a constant cycle of self-destruction and depression and staying in a place that enables such habits is detrimental. I'm just so scared of everything going wrong. My older sibling moved out over a year ago and it was messy and triggering (i wont go into detail) I just want to change my life for the better SO badly.

MentalHealthSupport,"To start, I do not consider our relationship abusive. We love eachother deeply, we’re as united as two people can be when it comes to our beliefs, interests, values, goals, etc. There is no physical violence, and even though we sometimes disagree, we never fight. We’ve been through so much together, and I can’t imagine my life without him. 

That said, we are both very mentally ill. Without getting into too much detail, we’re both pretty fucked up between our traumas (both old and new) and a slew of other disorders. We are both medicated but still struggling. Doing our best to survive. Living paycheck to paycheck. A lot if our biggest hurdles are external factors that we have no control over and which exacerbate our mental health issues. 

He’s got it worse than me by far, though. He struggles with a physical disability on top of his mental health issues. He is still able to work, but has minimal capacity to do manual labor and chores, and that includes housework. I do all the housework. I’m more often than not the one who makes our meals.    There’s even some personal grooming I started doing for him because for a variety of reasons—depression, fatigue, or he just doesn’t know how) 

I love him. He’s brilliant and creative and kind, but he’s not very self sufficient, and has serious attachment issues. He’s also extremely picky when it comes to what we do at any given time. I can’t tell you how many times he’s promised me we’d do something (even just watching a movie) and then inevitably break that promise because his ADHD/ASD just isn’t in the place for it. It’s happened pretty much every time, even on holidays and my birthday. He’s not very social either and doesn’t like to leave our room, let alone the apartment. And he gets depressed if I’m not spending enough time with him (especially if I happen to spend time with others, which doesn’t happen much anymore) which in turn makes me feel shitty about myself. 

Anytime I express the things that upset me, he listens, he understands, then falls into a spiral of self-loathing and ultimately nothing changes. I feel like it’s pointless to bring up things that upset me, because nothing’s going to change and I’ll just upset him, and when he’s upset it upsets me. Especially because he starts talking about how he doesn’t deserve me and is constantly afraid I’ll leave him. And I beleive these are his genuine feelings, not a tactic. He’s a sweet person, but he is so unfathomably broken. 

I love him. He’s my best friend, my family, but pretty much my entire life revolves around taking care of him these days. I feel stuck. He needs help that I can’t give him. He needs Therapy, but we’re poor, and have to go with what’s available through healthcare. He’s been on a waitlist forever. We can’t afford any other alternatives.

MentalHealthSupport,"

For the first point, I feel like there is no real me, just copies of people and personalities I came across in life mixing up and forming more and more personalities that I use to my advantage depending on who I'm talking to and thinking of it I realised that I don't know who I am.
For the second point, it's similar to the first: I feel like a kind and empathic person but then 5 minutes later I can hope for the worst to some people and be an asshole.
As a kid I never had the ""I want to change the world to the better"" phase, I already knew the world was fucked up and it deserved immense pain, sometimes I can feel attached to my father but as of now he is very sick and I don't know why but I feel more joy seeing him suffer than sadness, and it isn't because that's him, it's the same with everybody. But still if I see a video of a guy who lost his dog I can feel sadness and empathy but sometimes I wonder if I really feel emotions or just fake them because ""crazy"" people don't belong in society and as a kid I never thought of that and often got in trouble for being violent for the dumbest reasons like a kid making fun of my second name.
Sometimes I pass near a prison and think ""damn it would be cool"" then try to suppress it thinking ""it would be awful"" but it doesn't work.
To some people I am humble and sometimes I think I am while the day later I'm the biggest narcissist and full of pride. I enjoy when people praise me and when they insult me, I wait for someone to cross me so I can return the favour in worst ways.
Sometimes I do reckless stuff not caring about the consequences and sometimes I stop because of them.
I've come to the conclusion that I don't know myself and I can't expect for someone else to know my real self either.

MentalHealthSupport,"So I have large or small gaps in my past memories probably due to childhood emotional/mental/physical abuse, growing up in a tense, toxic environment. 

Even the memories I technically remember are blurry, and in the sense as though they are written down, like if I try to access a particular memory, like a school trip or my dad yelling at me, my mind will pick out that memory as though it's a written file, but I will struggle to imagine it visually or auditorily.

It's part of why sometimes, depictions of domestic violence or mental abuse don't always trigger me, mostly cuz I go numb and I can't really recall the details, like I know it happened but I don't relive it. Sometimes I do get triggered pretty strongly. It's like a bunch of emotions resurfacing at once but I don't know exactly why.

MentalHealthSupport,"My name is Aisha, and today I turned 23. I’m from the Netherlands, and for the past two years, I’ve been struggling with severe depression. I could explain how it all developed, but maybe that’s a story for another time. Right now, I feel like I’ve hit the peak—or rather, the lowest point—of it.

The smallest change in someone’s behavior, a subtle remark, or a small shift in tone… and I can dwell on it for an entire week. Overthinking it, analyzing every little detail. It keeps me up at night. And when I say that, I mean it literally. I haven’t been able to sleep properly for two years. I go entire nights without rest, running on maybe two hours of sleep before heading to work.

University? That hasn’t been an option for a while. I haven’t attended in over a year and a half. Not because I don’t want to, but because I’m too afraid. And that’s what’s been running through my head for two years: I’m afraid. Afraid to choose myself. Afraid to love myself. Afraid to show myself to others—or, sometimes, I show too much.

Ironically, the only thing I managed to hold onto during these two years of depression was work. I kept going, even when it felt impossible. And now, even that is gone. This week, I was told my temporary contract would not be renewed. That’s life, I guess. But I honestly didn’t see it coming. My position in the company was strong. I know that. They promised me growth. They told me they wanted to keep me—just a month ago. If that’s not the case, then at the very least, I should have been given transparency.

This is depression. Objectively, losing a job isn’t the end of the world. I’m young. I can find another job. I’ve been in a leadership position, which looks good on my resume. But that’s not what really bothers me. What truly worries me is that this job was the only reason I ever went outside.

Friendships? I’ve let them go the way you cancel a subscription. Did that make me sad? Yes. Am I still sad about it? Absolutely. Do I still open up to people? Sometimes. But do I ever really get that effort back? Rarely.

It feels like no matter what I do…

I’m too much. Or not enough.
I try too hard. Or not hard enough.
Am I too kind? Or too distant?
Too loud? Or too quiet?
Too assertive? Or too passive?

Nothing feels right. Everything is something to worry about. Everything is something to overthink at night. And so, I don’t sleep.

And today, on my birthday, it was all too much. I’ve had multiple panic attacks, and my body is completely exhausted from the anxiety. I feel drained—mentally and physically.

Did life pass me by? I’m 23. I’m supposed to be in the prime of my life. So why doesn’t it feel that way?

As a teen, I knew exactly who I was and where I was going. I had ambitions. I knew who I was. I knew who I was. Maybe that’s why I made it so far in school. But I did it all alone. There was no space for me at home. I don’t blame anyone, but now I’m here, lost. What do you do when you no longer know who you are? What you want? What your purpose is? When everything you’ve been through has left you completely drained?

A 23-year-old doesn’t need a big celebration for their birthday. But honestly, today didn’t feel like a celebration at all. Today felt… I don’t even know what word to use. Today just felt awful.

It might surprise you, but I spent my 22nd birthday in a hospital. No one came. Except for one friend. Maybe I should have known then that no one would reach out this year either. But part of me still hoped that someone would check in. Not just a quick “happy birthday,” but someone genuinely asking how I was doing. Maybe then, I could have stressed about how to respond. About how to say, “Hey, I’m doing fine. How are you?”

My birthday last year changed something in me. I was hospitalized.That moment broke something inside me. The feeling of loneliness and fear is perhaps the very core of depression. Depression is hard to deal with. But the worst part of it is this: being afraid.

Afraid to do something.
Afraid to try.
Afraid to live.

I don’t know exactly why I’m writing this here. Maybe just to get it out of my head. Maybe someone will read this and see themselves in it. Or maybe it’s just a way to remind myself that I’m still here.

It...bothers me to hear people do not find me valuable because I never had any troubling experiences or debilitating trauma. It bothers me that I won't be seen as worthy of their affection unless I'm useful to them as a tool. People like me are never described as people, but as warnings for others to not end up like us.

  
I'm 22, but it really feels like I should be someone else right now. Someone better. Someone with more struggles to learn from to teach their family, friends,  strangers, or future generations. But I'm not the type of person who notices problems in the world. I usually live in my own world when I get bored instead of seeking out external experiences. I've read about people like me described as ignorant, and because I'm ignorant any opinion about the world I could have is rendered pointless. Any pain that I think matters, doesn't matter because of my lack of experience. I can't tell which feelings that I have are valid anymore. I'm just confused and it feels like I shouldn't be unhappy ever again.

I'm such a loser. Everything I read I'm described as a some inferior, low-quality person because I didn't grow up hard enough. My co-workers, parents, and acquaintances have jokingly compared me to a serial killer more than once. Am I really that insensitive? I try to be considerate like other people all the time. I mean I'm empathic enough to the point where I can't stand the simple idea of hurting anything or anyone. Isn't that like most people? It really hurts when people call me labels like that. It feels like they think I'm *incapable* of being normal because I'm having trouble with certain skills (social skills, handy technical skills, etc.) that the majority find easy.

Am I truly a defective person? Because I'm starting to believe that I am. Maybe I should've bashed my head harder against that wooden chair when I was 14. Someone seemingly as worthless as me shouldn't have been born to steal resources from some kid who needed it more. Everything about me smells rotten for some reason and I feel so ugly most of the time. I don't know. My life up to now is so embarrassing. It's not a life anybody would care about.

MentalHealthSupport,"I (16F) think im losing my mind.

This all started around early june last year. I had just gotten out of a seriously abusive relationship and i started doing things for cash. My parents found out and i stopped and had everything taken away for a while until school starts, so i had zero contact with any of my friends. During this time i discovered my severe lack of empathy- i didnt care about how anyone felt, and if i did it was because i was consciously trying to and it was 100% fabricated. By august, I had permanently destroyed my friendship with these two girls who were my entire life- Ill call them Kathrine and Marie. Me and Kathrine dated about four times on and off, and every time we went back to being friends. Both of us have a habit of dating anyone we get close with and manipulating our partners- the difference is, however, Kathrine doesnt know shes doing it. I know i did it after it happened. We were possibly the worst couple ever. We also both low-key had a crus on our third friend, Marie. She's beautiful, smart, and kind. Kathrine is independent, gorgeous, and sweet. You know how theres always an ugly friend? That was me. I always felt out of place and like they were closer than i was to them. After I dated my formerly mentioned ex, Flynn, I was the worst. I treated them horribly. I apologized every single day, agreed to every change i had to make, respected every boundary even if i knew it was only to irritate me. I did all I could and in the end, they still cut me off. I understand why- Kathrine told me she loved me and that she thought she might be a lesbian after breaking up with her ex, C. I said the same, not wanting to lose her. I ended up breaking it off and dating her ex (C) which was the worst thing i ever did in my opinion. 

This december, I spiraled. My parents isolated me- I was a very social girl all my life but in november my parents cleared everything out of my room, took my phone and computer, and locked me in my room. I couldnt visit anyone. No one could visit me. I just sat. At school i was drained and i got anxious because i didnt have Kathrine or Marie anymore and they were essentially my only friends. I had no one. I had also recently been outed as bisexual, which isnt as looked down upon where i live (california) but its still very not normal in my town. 

I lost so many friends, I was isolated, I really didnt have much. I wanted to die.

I began to get paranoid- by january, i couldnt stand eyes. I hated the feeling of being looked at- i had art i had made on my walls and during a bad night, i took thick black paint and covered the eyes. I taped over the eyes of a tapestry with characters on it. I turned stuffed animals and dolls the other way. I was terrified.

I carved things into my skin- not deep but enough to make a scar. i held lighters under my right hand (I lost feeling in the fingers 2 years ago) just to remember it was still there.

that brings us to now. ive been documenting whats been happening.

""I feel like im losing my fucking mind, and maybe I am. im so exhausted that i cant get through even half my class without dissociating. I cant tell the difference between reality and dreams now. everything is blending together. It hasnt caused any serious problems yet, other than serious confusion.""

""Monday-I thought i had an argument with my dad. I cant remember what was said now, but i remember his face. he was holding my backpack and yelling at me. I blacked out after that, then my memory cuts to later in the night when i apologized. he looked confused- he didnt know at all what i was talking about. Whats happening?""

""Tuesday- \[entry is literally scribbled out and i cant read it. i dont know when i did this.\]""

""Wednesday- Last night, i could've sworn i had some cash in my backpack's (very small yet deep) side pocket.

This morning i searched through to put it in my wallet- not there. looked through the whole thing, nothing.

MentalHealthSupport,"I want to start off with how much I love and adore my boyfriend. We’ve been together about three years and I don’t hesitate when I say he’s my best friend. 

The last two years have been hard, however, because he’s developed what I can only imagine to be PTSD/anxiety/OCD/a combo and I don’t know how to help him overcome these issues oe how to cope myself.

Long story short: 2 years ago BF had what we thought was a blown ear drum/ear infection after playing the drums at a band audition. The pain was super intense and constant for months on months, culminating in several MRIs, appointments with ENTs, a neurologist, and even getting a brain scan before finally being diagnosed with severe nasal polyps and getting sinus surgery.

Good news: The surgery solved the pain issue!

Bad news: Ever since the incident, he’s actively avoided anything that he thinks is or will be remotely loud. Concerts, crowded restaurants, movie theaters, etc. He’s abandoned me at networking events once the music starts and sat in the car, we’ve lost money on concert tickets, he abandoned the reception of his best friend’s wedding because the DJ was allegedly too loud, etc.

He’s had his ear drums checked by multiple doctors who all say that aside from minor damage sustained from being in drumline back in college, his ear drums look great. No damage, no hearing issues, nada.

It hasn’t changed a thing.

It has now evolved from just his ears to other aspects of his life: he’s terrified anything can hurt him.

1) He made me wash my hands after cleaning up glass because he was convinced there’s shards in my hands. I used a broom and a dustpan.

2) He straight up refused to have sex with me for months because he was convinced I was going to get pregnant (I have an IUD and we’d already had relations plenty of times before this with no issue) and he’d never sleep again because a close friend was talking in their group chat about how hard newborn trenches are.

3) I moved a bottle of bleach bathroom solution from the counter to under the sink and he insisted I wash my hands because they had to be covered in bleach. (They weren’t).

4) He refuses to pick up anything remotely heavy, bend down to pick something up, etc because he’s convinced he’s going to somehow injure his back.

5) He freaked out that I wanted to start a fire in the fireplace at the beginning of winter because the flume wasn’t open. I had already opened it. He insisted on not only checking it for himself but also contacting a professional to verify via FaceTime.

… plus more, too many to fit here.

Hes been in therapy for two months and is taking a low dose of anti-anxiety but the issues still persist.

He won’t go to any social functions with me. It’s like my boyfriend’s a ghost of who he used to be.

I don’t know how to cope because when his anxiety or whatever gets triggered, it triggers MY anxiety, which manifests as anger, and the whole situation blows up.

Some additional context to this: I also have high functioning autism. 

Okay so, for the last 3-4 months I’ve been super socially withdrawn, basically lost every good connection I had, but I’m not particularly sad about it.

I literally don’t go out.

Despite all this, I gained a new friend recently. We’re in year 11, nearly GCSE’s, and have been exclusively school friends so far. She’s very nice, and very cool, and she’s invited me to her gig later on. She also invited me out yesterday but I cancelled because I was ill and also couldn’t be bothered. I felt very bad about it, and I’m scared to cancel again as she told me about a ‘three strike rule’ where if people cancel on her, or leave her on read, or don’t reply to her three times then she stops reaching out. I was like ‘yes! go you!’ but now I’m just worried. I do want to have a close friend, especially one like her, but this gig later… idk.

If i don’t go, it’ll be my ‘second strike’. we’ve only been friends a week, and she has BPD so i don’t want her to ‘split’ on me or something. Especially since I take ages to reply because even if I really adore someone, most of the time I will just leave it for god knows how long. some of my closest friends have been on delivered for a month or so now. Which I know will make her mad!

But this is our first week of school break, and I just wanted to spend this week at home, cosy, warm, playing pokemon. I’m not sure if I’m allowed to say this but I’m currently at my lowest weight ever, despite that, I’ve been feeling good mentally these few days, ans have wanted to spend this week just in slack off mode so monday I can start fresh and reestablish my routine.

If i go to the gig i will have to take ages travelling, spend ages at the gig, get home late (awful for my routine), drink alcohol (i want to but…), stay over at my grandparents house (love them but i will want to leave asap, offending them), be freezing cold, feel awful the next day, and also I DONT WANT TO. i haven’t done anything social out of school in like 3 months, and even though i probably should, and i want to be friends with this person, i just don’t want to.

however, i will might regret it, she will be mad, i will feel lonely, it might be fun, drinking again might be fun, i may get some new friends, and i probably should try and be more social.

plus my ED is telling me ‘yesss a chance to show off!’

anyway, i just don’t know what to do, when i think of even starting to get ready I just feel really annoyed and upset. I just want to not go and not have repercussions, im not social, i dont talk to people outside of school, but i do feel like i should because 
i get lonely and feel unseen so maybe it’ll be good.

I can’t tell what’s best here. All i know is stay home and play pokemon and clean room = good emotional response tinged with guilt vs go, be cold, maybe have fun, maybe build friendship, not feel lonely and unseen = bad emotions, resentment, disruption but also some sense that its good for me

what do i do. i cant make good judgements. Go or not? and why?

MentalHealthSupport,"Managing PTSD: My Real-World Coping Method

Overview

This method is based on personal experience, developed over years of trial and adaptation. It is not a cure but a proven way to lower PTSD’s frequency and severity through controlled emotional release, proactive stress management, and brain training.

While this approach was created for self-management, it could be adapted professionally to provide a structured and safe alternative for people struggling with PTSD.

Key Components of My Method

1. Controlled Emotional Release (CER)
	•	Instead of suppressing PTSD-related anger, I channel it into a controlled, safe space.
	•	This involves breaking pre-damaged objects using a baseball bat and safety gear.
	•	It mimics the natural fight response, allowing for stress hormone release in a non-destructive way.
	•	The result is a relief similar to post-intense exercise.

2. Dual Processing: Physical + Verbal Expression
	•	I release emotions in two ways:
	•	Physically through high-intensity actions.
	•	Verbally by speaking freely, alone, without judgment.
	•	This prevents bottled-up emotions and creates a complete emotional reset.

3. Training the Brain’s Reward System
	•	Over time, I trained my brain to love the relief that comes at the end of each session.
	•	By reinforcing the dopamine reward, PTSD became less overpowering.
	•	This rewiring helped me lower PTSD’s grip without suppressing it.

4. Proactive Stress Prevention
	•	Instead of waiting for PTSD to trigger, I train before stress builds up.
	•	This keeps emotional energy under control and prevents random PTSD bursts.
	•	Over time, the frequency and intensity of PTSD episodes naturally decreased.

5. Grounding & Separation from PTSD
	•	At the end of each session, I actively reconnect with reality.
	•	I remind myself: PTSD is an experience, not my identity.
	•	This helps separate past trauma from present life, making symptoms more manageable.

Why This Could Be Useful for PTSD Treatment
	•	Cost-Effective & Practical: Requires minimal setup and can be adapted to safe environments.
	•	Addresses PTSD in the Moment: Allows real-time processing, not just reflection.
	•	Prevents Suppression: Actively releasing emotions reduces unpredictable PTSD symptoms.
	•	Brain Training & Long-Term Benefits: Over time, it rewires the brain’s response to PTSD.
	•	Could Be Professionally Structured: With supervised adaptation, this could help patients release trauma safely.

Final Thought

I am not a professional therapist, but I have lived with PTSD for over 30 years. My approach worked for me, and I believe it could help others.

This is not a universal solution, but if even one person finds relief using this method, then sharing it will have been worth it. If adapted properly, I believe this could enhance PTSD treatment by offering an alternative, experience-based approach to processing trauma.

He then went on to tell me that I am the cause of his headache, drives him crazy and only adds to his mental load. I am not perfect but in no way do I see my actions like that. I’m also not trying to look the better person here. My point here is that whenever he is going through something and I try to be there for him, he shuts me down and proceeds to blame me for all the stress he has.

I’m so tempted to share ss but I’m also valuing his privacy. (…I also know some people post these things on other platforms)

Anyway, instead of him staying to solve the issue with me, he still went out to drink. My feelings felt so invalidated and I felt so sad about it.

Now I am questioning myself if I wasn’t loving him enough or was I not a good person in the first place? People around me always tell me that I’m the kindest and most patient person they know so I’m wondering if he sees me the same way. 

I can’t share the context too where the argument all began but it came to a point that he counted all the ”favors” he did. Saying that “after everything Ive done for you. I gave you my all —yada yada”

He also has a habit of shouting and calling me names. Which he never did when we are still friends.

Ive deactivated all my social platforms and resigned at work because my head and my heart hurts so bad that I can’t function. 

I never wanted him to be perfect. I just want to be heard. I just wanted to be understood. I just wanted to feel validated.

But just like that, we’re over.

MentalHealthSupport,"I haven’t posted on here before so here’s some backstory.

I’m 21 years old, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 3 years ago. I haven’t been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder but from the research I’ve done and the people I’ve spoken to, the diagnosis fits.

My moods will fluctuate quite heavily, with anywhere from 3 to five days of elevated mood, and then weeks of normality and then I either go back up or I sink low. When I sink low, it’s for a while, we’re talking 2-3 weeks to a month. And then some more normality.

I spoke to my GP and they referred me to the primary care liaison who referred me to my local mind charity.

The past 5 weeks, I have been treated as though I have a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. I’ve been given tricks and tips to deal with mania and depression and ways to see the episodes coming. My support worker has said many times that my symptoms match up to bipolar so I leaned on the diagnosis.

I spoke to a GP at my surgery, not one that I’ve ever seen before and she quite literally said that none of my symptoms match up to bipolar. We had a 15 minute phone call and she basically told me not to chase this diagnosis. She told that my symptoms swing towards EUPD and/or complex emotional needs and not towards bipolar.

I want a diagnosis, something to lean on and be like ah, I know why I’m feeling this way. But no one seems to want to give me one. And I understand, I’m 21 therefore I’m still young but these symptoms aren’t hormonal imbalances.

I’m feeling really conflicted, like no one knows what’s going on with me.

The news that the unofficial diagnosis I’ve been leaning on for the past 6 months is wrong, is painful. And I understand symptoms can cross over just like treatment. But I want something definite.

I was working a 14 hour day and felt like she brushed me off.

I now am not wanting to talk to her about therapy because it’s already not super natural for me to go and I feel some type of way like upset.

MentalHealthSupport,"I'm 25F, diagnosed with severe depression,  cPTSD and social anxiety.
My family life was never great, but there are people who had it way worse than me. My parents were emotionally immature and unavailable. I used to hide in the wardrobe hoping they'd come find me after the recent blow up my dad had, maybe apologise and console me, but they never did. I loved my big brother, who moved out for uni when i was 7.
My dad died after a work accident, my mom lied to me for a week until she just couldn't anymore. I begged her to go see him. He died a few days later and i woke up to her telling me i don't have a dad anymore.
This really broke me. I was outgoing and had tons of friends, but after that I just wanted to die.
My life after that was just me trying to earn money, because my mom had to pay off my dads debt and the bills. Ahe was emotionally uninvolved, usually out with friends after work. I was alone. I could do whatever and i thought it was great. I wasn't terrible. We did get drunk a lot, but we were all good kids, that didn't get in trouble. I was always an A student, without trying, so i guess everything looked fine. 1st year of uni i broke and realised i have depression and an suicidal.  I also realised that all that i wanted like success and money was entirely so i could be loved by my mom and brother and so i could take care of my mom. 
My brother is the successful one. He's 10 years older, has 2 kids and has always been my hero. But yk, what they say ... don't meet your idols. When I grew up i realised how much impact his opinions had on me. I was always struggling to be successful,  to not be fat, to be good at everything, to be someone he liked. So our relationship turned sour, when i had a mental breakdown and went to a therapist for the first time. I wanted him to be proud of me, but instead his words crushed  me. It was the worst episode I've had. After that i decided to stay alive, but to not try. Its easier. The truth is, I'd choose to be dead any day. Even if that day was not terrible. I'm  someone who loves cute things, loves to handmake stuff, but i don't find it enjoyable anymore. I stay in my room the whole day. I moved back in with my mom years ago, after i dropped out. My business that kept us afloat is failing, because i hate doing everything alone. I burnt out years ago after i almost got a kidney infection from working 14 days without sleep. 
I made up with my mom. It's true that perhaps I'm still codependent. I've always lived only for her and my brother. I didn't want to cause them the same pain we went through. She knows everything now and i understand her. I've forgiven her. She's a good mom to adult me. 
But now I'm scared.
Her brother, my uncle got a brain hemorrhage last night. She came back at 7pm and told me. You know what my first thought was, after learning he's alive in the hospital? What about the apartment they share? What if his kid takes it? How could i even think of that??? It might very well have been an intrusive thought, but HOW?! I went with her to his place and i just thought, wow i don't think i can care about anyone anymore. When her mom, my grandma died, after months of dementia,  where i saw her deteriorate, i didn't even cry. I had to fake my grief when i was at the coffin.
And now this. My uncle wasn't a bad person or anything. He lives close to us, in my grandmas old place. He was alone. I asked him to use one room, when i had to move my office and he agreed instantly. I'd see him aometimes when i went there and we'd chat for a few minutes. He lived in filth. I think me and my mom would clean and then he never would keep it up. I always wondered if  he also has depression.
His child and ex wife live on he other wnd of the country and he's probably met him twice after we stopped being kids. He finally got a better job, although he was really exhausting himself because it's a warehouse job. 
Anyways, in many ways, he only has my mom and me i guess. And yet, last night i sat there and didn't even feel sad. What is sadness? How should i have felt? I just feel terrible for my mom. That's her only family left. She had to go through so many deaths. She had to take care of ao many people. And here i am, thinking of ways to also just die. But i cant. Because i can't do that to her. At the same time i am useless. I can't take care of them. I decided to be a failure, because i knew it'd be my own life to waste, but now i think, if my uncle survives this and needs care, i can't even pay for a place. We don't have a house where we can all live. If something happens to me, i know my brother won't be there for her.

Secondly, I ran away from home not long ago, after an argument with my mother and her partner, which turned physical (I did not touch anyone, I was pinned against the wall and had hands around my neck) and obviously social services is now doing its job on that.

I've tried killing myself once, by heading to the train tracks, but l've been thinking about it for over a year. Lastly, my ex-girlfriend cheated on me a few ago, and refuses to speak to me and I can't get out of my own head. I haven't eaten or slept since Tuesday.

Specifically, my thoughts are mainly about dying, or hurting myself (Which I haven't SH in a long time, and I'd like to keep it that way) and the thoughts of my Ex cheating on me, because I really do love her, and I feel guilty that I wasn't enough for her.


I'm just asking for help with how to distract myself from my thoughts. Everything is going a million miles per hour in my head, l've tried music, my medication and everything in between.

MentalHealthSupport,"I've not received a diagnosis for ADHD because I can't afford to get mental health support at this point in my life, but everybody in my life who has gotten close enough to me for me to be myself around has said they think I have it, and after a bit of denial, I looked into it and realised I regularly experience most of the symptoms. I am currently a bit unsure of whether it is thst or something else though. 

I know bipolar can be mistaken for adhd at times, and in a way I feel like that fits as I seem to experience all or almost all of the symptoms of the high and low states in mood swings, but these are a lot more rapid than in bipolar and are more within the range of within the hour to within the day as with mood swings in adhd. 

I guess the thing I'm confused about is, while fitting almost all the symptoms of adhd, I don't all the time, and will have periods where I feel really positive and seem to most people how they'd imagine somebody with adhd to be, and this can happen alone and make it difficult to focus ect. However, I also get deep depressive periods where everything feels useless and I'm incredibly low energy, unable to find enjoyment in anything and basically the opposite of the other state

When I'm in not in one, I find it impossible to imagine how it feels to be in them, and my memories of things are often overly positive and nostalgic, even when I was in a depressive state at a time. I find it almost impossible to remember any negative feelings and even if I write them down I can't understand them afterwards. That is probably the hardest thing to explain to people in my life. 

Some of the up states feel completely euphoric and border on what feels like insanity. I'll think of something stupid or nonsensical and be unable to stop laughing (sometimes even for no reason). This is often triggered by a build up of stress. Afterwards I'll feel guilt and embarrassment for how I acted despite the fact I couldn't control it and if I do manage to force myself out of it I will immediately drop into the depressive state. 

I will sometimes in a depressive state, feel no joy or love for anything in my life, even those which mean the most to me, and feel as if I would not feel anything if I lost it all and can't imagine them bringinge happiness. These can make it hard for me to act as I should to the people I love the most in my life. 

I'm sorry for all of this. I'm not looking for a diagnosis or anything and I know I need to go to a medical professional for that. I'm not asking for anybody to confirm or deny anything for me specifically as I know you don't know everything, but rn I just need to understand what is happening in my brain a little better and understand the labels which are being placed on me more.

My sister has a severe case of autism and we never got to bond  
I seldom saw/see my other relatives  
I only talked to my dog  
I was always the quiet kid in school, never had many friends, never hung out, was regarded as ""gifted"" (the usual pipeline)  
At 10 I wrote my first s letter, I don't even remember what was wrong, I just wanted to quit, I didn't have a plan to off myself, only wished I could, I found comfort in drawing  
At 14 I began s/h  
At 15 I finally started forming friendships in my city and got raped by a guy in that circle, I stayed in it even though everybody knew, my mother blamed me for it happening  
I felt extremely alone, and I still do, I actually cried in his arms, I didn't want to be lonely so I stuck to my groomer and our friends  
For a short time they got me into drugs until I decided to isolate myself and fell down into a deeper depression, quit all my hobbies, was an empty shell  
I started seeing therapists but no one really helped (I've had 4, but just 1 psychiatrist and a couple of meds that didn't make me feel better)  
My memories from covid are really fuzzy, I got into some messed up relationships but they're not important  
At 19 I started attending uni and realized I can't do shit anymore, I can't bring myself to study, can't understand most stuff, I'm afraid I've actually damaged my brain in some way (might be because of an overdose/mishandling of pharms), but I'm not sure and never had the courage nor the money to check in with a professional  
My boyfriend cheated on me some days before my 20th birthday (I didn't know about her but she knew about me) and then gifted me a ring, I found out through a friend of his much later, I'm still with him, I don't want to be lonely and I want to believe he changed even though it's killing me and I know I should've let go  
My rock, my childhood dog, has passed away recently  
My parents started fighting a lot and I was getting so suicidal I needed to get out and moved in a bad area of the city because I could only afford rent here  
I'm alone, I feel uncomfortable with everyone, I have some friends but I'm not even sure I can consider them as such (most of them have backstabbed me in a way or another, talked shit about me, wished death upon me, bonded with people who traumatized me such as my rapist and so on)  
I stopped believing in love and actual friendships, but I don't want to be lonely, but at the same time I don't want to get close to new people as I don't want to get hurt once again without expecting it  
There is nothing I enjoy anymore: not drawing, not reading, not dressing up, not doing my makeup, not hanging out
